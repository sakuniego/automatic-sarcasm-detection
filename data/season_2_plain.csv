38,TEST_0_38,Johnny," Nothing, and I'm getting nervous, Moira. ",,,0
39,TEST_0_39,Moira," Don't worry, he's fine. It's not the first time David's run away, remember all those troubled years in high school, when he'd charter the jet without permission?",,,0
40,TEST_0_40,Johnny," Yes, but he has no money.",,,0
41,TEST_0_41,Moira," Oh, he does now. If there's one thing David knows, it's the street value of a woman's bag.",,,0
42,TEST_0_42,Johnny," Okay, you know what, can we stop talking about that bag for five minutes, the bag, the bag, and the bag!",,,0
43,TEST_0_43,Moira," John, it's an heirloom, my great grandmother took it from her husband when she left him, and it has been passed down through all the women in my family, as emergency currency, in case we need to leave our husbands in the middle of the night.",,,0
44,TEST_1_44,Johnny," Oh, well, that's reassuring. ",SARCASTIC, Johnny does not like hearing that Moira may leave him in the middle of the night,1

62,TEST_0_62,Alexis, And now we're not. So...,,,0
63,TEST_1_63,Mutt," I would love to feel worse about your parents not selling the town, but... ",SARCASTIC," Mutt is exaggerating saying �love�, he is happy that Alexis is staying",1
64,TEST_0_64,Alexis," Hmm, it's just, it's so tragic, 'cause my mom is in this like, waking coma, and my dad has developed more of a stutter, and uh, because we're not leaving, things are a little bit complicated with Ted. ",,,0
65,TEST_0_65,Mutt, I thought things were done with Ted.,,,0
66,TEST_0_66,Alexis," Me too. But apparently, he was misinformed.",,,0
67,TEST_0_67,Mutt, By who?,,,0
68,TEST_0_68,Alexis, By me.,,,0
69,TEST_0_69,Mutt, Okay.,,,0
70,TEST_0_70,Alexis," Until that whole thing kinda works itself out, I have a moral obligation to Ted. You hands are so� Soft for someone who does nothing but manual labor.",,,0

82,TEST_0_82,Moira," Oh, I haven't lost him, i know exactly where he is. He's enjoying happy hour at the viceroy without me.",,,0
83,TEST_0_83,Johnny, It's been three days without any contact.,,,0
84,TEST_0_84,Roland," Johnny, you wouldn't know this, but statistics tell us you have a 48 hour window before you can assume somebody is dead.",,,0
85,TEST_0_85,Johnny," Yeah, I just said it's been three days.",,,0

103,TEST_0_103,Moira, Were there bags in the truck?,,,0
104,TEST_0_104,Twyla," My best friend in kindergarten ran away, and her parents didn't notice, and she ended up getting adopted by this really rich Asian family in Vancouver, but then they had their own kid, so she kind of got neglected a bit, and I can't remember whether she's back on the streets now, or...",,,0
105,TEST_0_105,Alexis," You know, and he took his hair straightener, which he knows that i use more than he does. This whole thing is just very selfish.",,,0

115,TEST_0_115,Alexis, Thank God you're here!,,,0
116,TEST_1_116,Ted," Of course, I've been trying to be here more for you, but I guess my texts haven't been getting through, or maybe I'm sending them wrong? ",RHETORICAL, Ted likely knows that Alexis has deliberately not been answering his texts,1

119,TEST_0_119,Alexis," Thank you, Ted, 'cause it's so hard to focus on something like that right now.",,,0
120,TEST_0_120,Ted," And I totally understand that. It's just... you had said that you wanted to get married if you weren't leaving town, and you didn't leave town, so...",,,0
121,TEST_0_121,Alexis," Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And I totally get that. Technically though, someone did leave, and so the dust just hasn't really settled on the whole... us leaving thing. Yet.",,,0

137,TEST_0_137,Johnny, Alexis! ,,,0
138,TEST_0_138,Alexis, I know!,,,0
139,TEST_0_139,Moira," This is exactly what David wants. All of us worried, and driving around in some tin can looking for him It's a tactic. It's subterfuge.",,,0
140,TEST_0_140,Johnny," Oh, you could be jumping to conclusions, Moira.",,,0
141,TEST_0_141,Moira," I taught him everything he knows. He shouldn't have left me behind, that was never part of the plan.",,,0
142,TEST_1_142,Alexis," Oh my God, ever since David left, you two have been so dramatic. Do I have to remind you of the time that I was taken hostage on David geffen's yacht by Somali pirates for a week, and nobody answered my texts?!

199,TEST_0_199,David, Why would you think that i would steal that bag? ,,,0
200,TEST_0_200,Moira," I don't know David, why did you steal my eyeliner?",,,0

226,TEST_0_226,David," Wow, believe it or not, that is one of the warmest welcomes I have received so far!",,,0
227,TEST_0_227,Stevie," Usually when you tell someone that you have feelings for them, and the next thing they do is drive out of town with no plan to return, you hope you never have to see them again.",,,0
228,TEST_0_228,David," Well, in my defense, um... I was intending on staying away for much longer, but I ran out of money, and forgot my phone charger.",,,0
229,TEST_1_229,Stevie," Oh, well, at least you were well intentioned. ",SARCASTIC, Stevie does not think he was well-intentioned,1
230,TEST_0_230,David," It's not like I didn't think about what you said. Um, after we spoke, I thought, well, there goes my one friend. Try saying that one out loud, it is very dark.",,,0
231,TEST_0_231,Stevie," Well... We will just have to work through this, won't we?",,,0
232,TEST_0_232,David," Uh-huh. Yes. Yeah, um, if that's what you- if that's what you want, then yes, I would like that very much. So um, I guess just tell me what you would like me to do, and I will do it.",,,0
233,TEST_0_233,Stevie," Okay, well, let's start by you leaving my office, and we'll see where that takes us.",,,0
