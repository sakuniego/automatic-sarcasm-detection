58,TRAIN_0_58,Johnny, It smells like a gym bag.,,,0
59,TRAIN_1_59,Moira, Does anyone else feel light headed? ,RHETORICAL, Moira is just telling everyone that she is light-headed.,1
60,TRAIN_0_60,Roland," Oh my God, this takes me back to high school. You know, I did the deed in just about every room in this place. Yep, if a forensic team came in here with one of those blue lights, this place would just light up! Okay, that's good.",,,0

77,TRAIN_0_77,Stevie, Okay...,,,0
78,TRAIN_0_78,David," And this might be a stupid question, considering the state of the rugs in our room, but do you have a business centre here?",,,0

86,TRAIN_0_86,Johnny, If you don't mind.,,,0
87,TRAIN_0_87,Roland," No problem there, Johnny, I don't mind helpin' out. Listen, one thing before I go here, um... Do you mind if I use your toilet?",,,0
88,TRAIN_0_88,Moira, Is it absolutely necessary? ,,,0
89,TRAIN_0_89,Roland," Uh, yeah, I would say it's absolutely necessary! Excuse me. Absolutely necessary. Yes, that train has left the station, if you know what I mean! ",,,0
90,TRAIN_0_90,David, I need that bed.,,,0
91,TRAIN_0_91,Alexis, Why?,,,0
92,TRAIN_0_92,David, Because I need it.,,,0
93,TRAIN_0_93,Alexis, Why?,,,0
94,TRAIN_0_94,David," Because if someone were to break in here in the middle of the night wanting to murder us, they would attack this bed first, so I need this bed. ",,,0
95,TRAIN_1_95,Alexis, So you're saying that you want me to get murdered first?!  In front of you? And then what would you do?  Would you just run away and leave me to bleed out... On the floor?! ,RHETORICAL, Alexis is explaining that David’s plan to have her be murdered first does not make sense.,1
96,TRAIN_0_96,David," Uh, sort of, that was the plan, yeah. ",,,0
97,TRAIN_0_97,Alexis," Okay. Well, you can have the bed when I leave. ",,,0

100,TRAIN_0_100,David, What do you mean Stavros is com... What do you mean? When? When is he doing that? ,,,0
101,TRAIN_0_101,Alexis," Like, whenever stupid Mary-Kate stops hogging his plane. ",,,0
102,TRAIN_0_102,David," Well, where are we going? ",,,0
103,TRAIN_0_103,Alexis," Okay, at present, he's just coming for me, but then I figured that we would just come back and grab you guys at some point. ",,,0
104,TRAIN_1_104,David," What kind of sociopath abandons her family in some vomit soaked dump, to gallivant around the world with her dumb shipping heir loser boyfriend she's known for three months?! ",RHETORICAL, David is pointing out that Alexis is being selfish.,1
105,TRAIN_0_105,Alexis," Um, David, it will be four months next month!",,,0
106,TRAIN_0_106,David, Oh my God!,,,0
107,TRAIN_0_107,Alexis," And he just told me that he could potentially see himself considering saying ""I love you"" at some point sometime soon, so... ",,,0
108,TRAIN_0_108,David," That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. I'm telling mom. I'm telling mom and dad, have you told them?",,,0
109,TRAIN_0_109,Alexis," No! No David, I'm waiting for the right opportunity. Okay, otherwise dad's gonna cry, and mom's gonna do that thing where she pretends that nothing's wrong, and then just doesn't talk to me for five months, and I don't want that.",,,0
110,TRAIN_0_110,David," Well, I need this bed! I need it, so.",,,0
111,TRAIN_0_111,Alexis," You know what, David?! You get murdered first for once!",,,0
112,TRAIN_0_112,David," No, you get murdered first!",,,0
113,TRAIN_0_113,Alexis," David, you get murdered first!",,,0
114,TRAIN_0_114,David," No, you! You do it!",,,0
115,TRAIN_0_115,Alexis," Yes, you get murdered first! David, you get murdered first!  I actually think this place is kinda cute. ",,,0
116,TRAIN_0_116,Moira," Did you say cute?  No Alexis, Martha Stewart's Hampton home is cute. ",,,0
117,TRAIN_0_117,David, Where's that weird man?  Where? ,,,0
118,TRAIN_0_118,Johnny, He's in the bathroom.  He... he won't leave! ,,,0
119,TRAIN_0_119,David," Well, he's been in there for a very long ti... Oh my God! Oh my God! ",,,0
120,TRAIN_0_120,Roland, Jeez. Um... Boy. Remind me to get that window fixed. It will not open. ,,,0
121,TRAIN_0_121,Johnny," Roland, listen, thank you very much, but I appreciate everything you've done, we need a little private time now, as a family. ",,,0
122,TRAIN_0_122,Roland," Sure, well actually, those curtains do close there so... Oh, look! You've got Channel 19! ",,,0
123,TRAIN_0_123,Johnny," Roland, could you get the fuck out?! ",,,0
124,TRAIN_0_124,T.V. announcer," This latest model is a revelation in innovation.  I am not lying folks, it's gonna last you a lifetime. You are gonna thank... ",,,0
125,TRAIN_0_125,Johnny," That was an overreaction. That was uncalled for. It's just... you know, we're a little tired, it's been a long day, there's a pharmacy worth of drugs wearing off on most of us right now, and I just think as a family, we just need a little time to chill. ",,,0
126,TRAIN_0_126,Roland," Johnny, please, you don't have to apologize, and you really don't have to hit me over the head with this sort of thing, I get it, you need your little family time and all that, I'm sure.  No problem. You know what I'll do, I'll um... I'll just get the f*ck out of here. ",,,0
127,TRAIN_0_127,David," Ugh, we have to eat in here?! ",,,0
128,TRAIN_0_128,Alexis, I think it's kinda sweet. ,,,0
129,TRAIN_0_129,Moira," Alexis, what's going on with you? ",,,0
130,TRAIN_0_130,Alexis, What do you mean? ,,,0
131,TRAIN_0_131,Moira," Seriously?!  The room was ""cute,"" this place is ""sweet.""",,,0
132,TRAIN_0_132,David," I am personally offended by this place, I don't know what you think is nice about it. ",,,0
133,TRAIN_0_133,Moira, The town is disgusting. It is gruesome.,,,0
134,TRAIN_0_134,Alexis," It is charming, it is quaint, it's like out of a storybook.",,,0
135,TRAIN_0_135,Johnny," Alexis, what the hell is the matter with you?!",,,0
136,TRAIN_0_136,Alexis," Okay... Stavros is flying in to get me, and I am going to go live with him for a little bit.",,,0
137,TRAIN_0_137,Moira," Well, that is not happening. And I am appalled that my baby girl has turned into a selfish, duplicitous whore! Oh, hello!",,,0
138,TRAIN_0_138,Twyla," Hi, I'm Twyla. I'll be your waitress today.",,,0
139,TRAIN_0_139,"Anyway, I read about you guys, and everything you've gone through, it sounds super crappy. ",,,,0
140,TRAIN_1_140,Johnny, Super crappy? ,RHETORICAL, Johnny knows it is terrible. He is making fun of Twyla’s word choice,1
141,TRAIN_0_141,Twyla," I had a second cousin in Elmdale who did telemarketing, he made a ton of money. It turns out his entire business was illegal, and he lost everything.",,,0
142,TRAIN_0_142,Johnny, Hm... not quite the same.,,,0
143,TRAIN_0_143,Twyla," Yeah, no, he went to prison, which is terrible, but... But he is learning Spanish, no mas, le duele! I think it means, ""stop, it hurts.""",,,0
144,TRAIN_0_144,Moira," Oh, wonderful anecdote. Could you give us a moment please?",,,0
145,TRAIN_0_145,Twyla,"Whenever you're ready, I'm just right over here.",,,0
146,TRAIN_0_146,Moira, I forbid you to abandon our family.,,,0
147,TRAIN_0_147,Alexis," I am a grown woman, mother.",,,0
148,TRAIN_0_148,Moira, This is an act of a spoiled child!,,,0
149,TRAIN_0_149,David, I think it's unforgivable! ,,,0
150,TRAIN_0_150,Alexis," I think that you're just super jealous, 'cause I'm getting out of here! Also, you have a big thing of dandruff on your eyebrow.",,,0
151,TRAIN_0_151,David, Don't do that!,,,0
152,TRAIN_0_152,Johnny," Kids, stop, stop!",,,0
153,TRAIN_0_153,Moira," The world is falling apart around us John, and I'm dying inside.",,,0
154,TRAIN_0_154,Johnny," Well, I'm feeling a little queasy myself. Oh, brisket!",,,0
155,TRAIN_0_155,David, Give me... some space!,,,0
156,TRAIN_0_156,Alexis, David!,,,0
157,TRAIN_0_157,Moira, John...,,,0
158,TRAIN_0_158,Moira, Oh my God!,,,0
159,TRAIN_0_159,Alexis, Umm...,,,0
160,TRAIN_1_160,Moira," These rooms did have doors, didn't they? ",RHETORICAL, Everyone knows the motel rooms had doors.,1
161,TRAIN_0_161,Johnny," Yeah, it's a hotel, they're hotel rooms!",,,0
162,TRAIN_0_162,David, It's a motel! These are motel rooms.,,,0
163,TRAIN_0_163,Alexis, What if they took our stuff?!,,,0
164,TRAIN_0_164,David, What stuff? There's no stuff to take.,,,0
165,TRAIN_0_165,Moira, I have stuff!,,,0
166,TRAIN_0_166,Johnny, Son of a bitch! ,,,0
167,TRAIN_0_167,Johnny," Yeah, I've got a problem.",,,0
168,TRAIN_0_168,Stevie, If this is about doors...,,,0
169,TRAIN_0_169,Johnny," Yeah, it's about doors, yeah, my doors are gone, my front door, somebody stole my doors! ",,,0
170,TRAIN_0_170,Stevie," Yeah, you're gonna have to talk to Roland about that. He lives just down the street, you make a left out of the motel and then another left. It's a house with a truck in the driveway.",,,0
171,TRAIN_0_171,There's a bumper sticker of a naked Helen Mirren.,,,,0
172,TRAIN_0_172,Moira," Oh my God, no! No! No! ",,,0
173,TRAIN_0_173,Alexis, What?!,,,0
174,TRAIN_0_174,Moira, Ah! My earrings! They were there. They're not there!,,,0
175,TRAIN_0_175,David, Where did they go?,,,0
176,TRAIN_0_176,Moira," I don't know! I don't know! First you threatened to abandon me, and now my precious diamonds are gone! ",,,0
177,TRAIN_0_177,Alexis," Okay, you are super dramatic right now.",,,0
178,TRAIN_0_178,Moira, Shut up and look for them! Get open!,,,0
179,TRAIN_0_179,Johnny," Roland, I see you behind the truck!",,,0
180,TRAIN_1_180,Roland," Yeah, of course you see me. I'm looking at my gravel. Gravel these days, what are you gonna do? ",RHETORICAL, Roland is stalling.,1
181,TRAIN_0_181,Johnny," Yeah, it's gravel.",,,0
182,TRAIN_0_182,Roland," Yeah, it's gravel! Hey, good news for you. I talked to a guy about that bathroom window.",,,0
183,TRAIN_0_183,Johnny, That's the least of my concerns right now! ,,,0
184,TRAIN_0_184,Roland," Oh really? Well, why don't we address your concerns?! ",,,0
185,TRAIN_0_185,Johnny, The doors! I want my doors back!,,,0
186,TRAIN_0_186,Roland, Oh!,,,0
187,TRAIN_0_187,Johnny, Before it gets dark! My son is afraid of moths.,,,0
188,TRAIN_0_188,Roland," Oh, hmm. Well, here's the thing about that Johnny, you see, you did a bad thing. You disrespected me in front of your family! And now they think less of me.",,,0
189,TRAIN_0_189,Johnny," I doubt that's possible. And to be honest, you were kinda breathing down our necks a little bit back at the motel.",,,0
190,TRAIN_0_190,Roland," Johnny, when I was a kid and I did a bad thing, my father took the doors off my room. And he said to me, ""Roland, privacy is earned.""",,,0
191,TRAIN_0_191,Johnny, I am having a tough time following that. What the hell does that have to do with privacy?,,,0
192,TRAIN_0_192,Roland," Nothing. I just got mad, and I took your doors.",,,0
193,TRAIN_0_193,Johnny," Look, if you took offense to anything I said back at the motel, just know it wasn't personal.",,,0
194,TRAIN_0_194,Roland," All right, apology accepted.",,,0
195,TRAIN_0_195,Johnny," Well, that was less of an apology, and more of an explanation.",,,0
196,TRAIN_0_196,Roland," Nevertheless, I accept your apology.",,,0
197,TRAIN_0_197,Johnny, Which it wasn't!,,,0
198,TRAIN_0_198,Roland, So thank you again for that apology.,,,0
199,TRAIN_0_199,Johnny," Well, there was no apology, and I can't do this anymore!",,,0
200,TRAIN_0_200,Roland," You said you're sorry in a very sweet and humble way, and that takes a big man to do that, and that's what Johnny Rose is! A big man! Ooh! ",,,0
201,TRAIN_0_201,Moira," Oh!  Hello! Hello! Hi, hello, come here, please. I don't suppose you saw any hobos or crackheads loitering around the hotel today?",,,0
202,TRAIN_0_202,Stevie," No crackheads, no...",,,0
203,TRAIN_0_203,Moira," While the rooms were exposed to the world like a Moroccan fair, someone got in here and stole my earrings. But it was just... but it was just you here today.",,,0
204,TRAIN_0_204,Stevie, It was.,,,0
205,TRAIN_0_205,Moira, It was. I'm assuming you were the only one here on the premises today? ,,,0
206,TRAIN_0_206,Stevie, I think I know where you're going with this. ,,,0
207,TRAIN_0_207,Moira," No, I'm simply confirming that you alone were here when the earrings were stolen.",,,0
208,TRAIN_0_208,Stevie, Are you asking me if I stole your earrings?,,,0
209,TRAIN_0_209,Moira," No, I would never, please! But I also would certainly never press charges if my earrings were suddenly to be returned. If they suddenly reappeared, if you gave them back I would not press charges, I would look the other way. ",,,0
210,TRAIN_1_210,Stevie," Okay, you know what? I gotta run. 'Cause I wanna hit the pawn shop before it closes. I owe my crack dealer a ton of money, so. You seem like you have this under control, though. ",SARCASTIC, Stevie did not steal the earrings. She is joking to make Moira think she is going to the pawn shop to sell the earrings.,1
211,TRAIN_0_211,David, What just happened?! ,,,0
212,TRAIN_0_212,Moira," David, I politely asked that concierge girl if she had stolen my earrings, and she turned ice cold, and now she's on her way to a pawn shop! ",,,0
213,TRAIN_0_213,David," What?! I need a towel! Hello, hi. Hi, I am sorry if my mom accused you of taking something. ",,,0
214,TRAIN_0_214,Stevie, It's fine.,,,0
215,TRAIN_0_215,David," Okay, but does this mean that when you're cleaning our rooms, you're gonna put weird stuff in our beds out of spite, or something? ",,,0
216,TRAIN_0_216,Stevie, I won't be cleaning your room.,,,0
217,TRAIN_0_217,David," Okay, can I ask you a question?",,,0
218,TRAIN_0_218,Stevie, Shoot.,,,0
219,TRAIN_0_219,David, I think you're kind of rude!,,,0
220,TRAIN_1_220,Stevie, Is that a question? ,RHETORICAL, It was not a question,1
221,TRAIN_0_221,David," I have asked you thrice now for a towel, so that I may wash this town off my body. Do you think I wanna be here?",,,0
222,TRAIN_0_222,Stevie, Do you think I wanna be here?! ,,,0
223,TRAIN_0_223,David," I don't know what you want, you've given me one word answers since I got here!",,,0
224,TRAIN_0_224,Stevie, So if I get you a towel you'll stop following me to my car?,,,0
225,TRAIN_0_225,David, Yes! Yes!,,,0
226,TRAIN_0_226,Stevie," Fine, but I'm only doing this because you called me rude, and I take that as a compliment. The man is a lunatic! ",,,0
227,TRAIN_0_227,Johnny, What the hell happened here?,,,0
228,TRAIN_0_228,Moira, We've been robbed. Right now some local is pawning my earrings for crank.,,,0
229,TRAIN_0_229,Johnny, Your diamonds?!,,,0
230,TRAIN_0_230,Moira," Yes, my diamonds, the one thing I could hide under my tongue.",,,0
231,TRAIN_0_231,Johnny," Moira, I took your earrings out of here, and I put them in my shoe. For safekeeping.",,,0
232,TRAIN_0_232,Alexis," No! No! . Stavros just texted me. And he ended it, he's not coming! He said he doesn't have time to come and get me, because he already rsvp'd to Diddy's white party, and doesn't have time to do both! But I was supposed to be his date to the white party!",,,0
233,TRAIN_0_233,Johnny," Alexis, he was never my favourite Stavros. I've hated that guy ever since he asked me to do lines with him at my sixtieth.",,,0
234,TRAIN_1_234,David," Just out of sheer curiosity, um, where do you stand now on whether or not you think this motel is cute? ",RHETORICAL, David knows Alexis does not think the motel is cute. He is rubbing the fact that her boyfriend broke up with her and she is stuck there with them in her face.,1
235,TRAIN_0_235,David," Like, is it still cute, or is it...",,,0
236,TRAIN_0_236,Alexis," You're a dick, David!",,,0
237,TRAIN_1_237,David," Oh, I'm a dick! Okay, did I dump you for a party?! ",RHETORICAL, David did not. Alexis’s boyfriend did.,1
238,TRAIN_0_238,Johnny," David, help me with the doors.",,,0
239,TRAIN_0_239,David," No I can't, I just got out of the shower.",,,0
240,TRAIN_0_240,Johnny, I need help with the doors.,,,0
241,TRAIN_0_241,David, Oh my God!,,,0
242,TRAIN_0_242,Alexis," David, help him with the doors!",,,0
243,TRAIN_0_243,David, You help him with the doors! ,,,0
244,TRAIN_0_244,Alexis, No!,,,0
245,TRAIN_0_245,Johnny," David, could you help me with the doors?!",,,0
246,TRAIN_0_246,David, It's air drying!,,,0
247,TRAIN_1_247,Moira," Pick up a hammer, and nail this coffin shut! ",SARCASTIC, Moira is saying the situation/motel is like their coffin in that they have basically died.,1
248,TRAIN_0_248,Alexis," As if I didn't see this coming. He's broken up with me five times already. Like, there was that time that he never met me in Rio, and remember that time that he gave me his ex wife's engagement ring? And then, last summer, that time that he left his Molly in my glove compartment, and then I got arrested?",,,0
249,TRAIN_0_249,David," Oh my God! Can you do me a huge favour? And never repeat this to anyone that you respect, okay? Okay? Okay.",,,0
250,TRAIN_0_250,Alexis, Okay.,,,0
251,TRAIN_0_251,Johnny," Kids, we just came in to say good night, and to remind you that we will get through this...",,,0
252,TRAIN_0_252,David," Okay, good night!",,,0
253,TRAIN_0_253,Johnny, As a family...,,,0
254,TRAIN_1_254,David, Warmest regards to you both. ,SARCASTIC," David wants Johnny to leave, so he is saying something pleasant, but he cuts Johnny off in the process.",1
255,TRAIN_0_255,Johnny, And that will end up on our feet in no time!,,,0
256,TRAIN_1_256,Moira," Of course, by then our feet will be shoeless, and filthy and mangled, from walking on cigarette butts and broken beer bottles. ",SARCASTIC," Moira is referring to the terrible state of the town, she does not mean this literally",1
257,TRAIN_0_257,Moira," So, seriously Alexis, enough about Stavros!",,,0
258,TRAIN_0_258,Alexis, I'm sorry if I am going through something right now!,,,0
259,TRAIN_0_259,David, You're going through something?!,,,0
260,TRAIN_0_260,Moira," Good night, children.",,,0
261,TRAIN_0_261,Johnny, Good night!,,,0
262,TRAIN_0_262,David, Good night.,,,0
263,TRAIN_0_263,Alexis, Good night.,,,0
264,TRAIN_1_264,Moira, Let's all pray we don't wake up. ,SARCASTIC," Moira is being dramatic, basically saying that she hopes they all die in their sleep. She is not being serious.",1
265,TRAIN_0_265,Johnny, Moira! Moira!,,,0
266,TRAIN_0_266,Moira, Hm.,,,0
267,TRAIN_0_267,Moira, Oh no! I just finally cried myself to sleep.,,,0
268,TRAIN_0_268,Johnny, The bed is soaking wet.,,,0
269,TRAIN_0_269,Moira, Is it blood?,,,0
270,TRAIN_0_270,Johnny, No! There's... there is leak in the ceiling. There is a brown disgusting drip coming.,,,0
271,TRAIN_0_271,Moira, Owwww!,,,0
272,TRAIN_0_272,Johnny, Look it! Look... oh my God.,,,0
273,TRAIN_0_273,Moira, I can't do it.,,,0
274,TRAIN_0_274,Johnny, This place is a dump! It's a dump!,,,0
275,TRAIN_0_275,Moira, I tried!,,,0
276,TRAIN_0_276,Johnny, You know what it's a hell hole.,,,0
277,TRAIN_0_277,Moira," I tired, John, but I can't!",,,0
278,TRAIN_0_278,Johnny, Wake up.,,,0
279,TRAIN_0_279,David, Ahh!,,,0
280,TRAIN_0_280,Alexis, Ahh!,,,0
281,TRAIN_0_281,Johnny," Start packing, the pluming is shot to hell in this place and we are getting out. We are getting out! ",,,0
282,TRAIN_0_282,David, What are you wearing? What is that? A nightgown? ,,,0
283,TRAIN_0_283,Johnny," It's a nightshirt, David. And that's not the issue. The issue is the brown sludge in my bed. We're selling the place!",,,0
284,TRAIN_0_284,David, It's 6:00 am! ,,,0
285,TRAIN_0_285,Johnny, What's the name of that mouthy kid at the front desk?,,,0
286,TRAIN_0_286,David," I don't know. I'm trying very hard not to connect with people right now. The mouth the mouth, the girl.",,,0
287,TRAIN_0_287,David, You might want to rethink the nightgown first. There's an ebenezer scrooge thing happening right now.,,,0
288,TRAIN_0_288,Alexis," Oh my God, that's who I was thinking of.",,,0
289,TRAIN_0_289,Johnny, You know what?! I'll do it myself.,,,0
290,TRAIN_1_290,David, My best to Bob Cratchit. ,SARCASTIC, David was referring to the nightgown giving Johnny a similarity to Bob Cratchit. He was not asking Johnny to actually give Bob Crachit his best,1
291,TRAIN_0_291,Johnny, Hello! Hello! Service? This bell is broken.,,,0
292,TRAIN_0_292,Stevie," Yeah, sorry. It's more or less decorative.",,,0
293,TRAIN_0_293,Johnny," There's a leak in my room. Brown, disgusting sewage water was dripping all over my bed this morning. I was soaking wet. So I need a plumber.",,,0
294,TRAIN_0_294,Stevie, You want me to call a plumber?,,,0
295,TRAIN_1_295,Johnny,  Do I want you to call a plumber? ,RHETORICAL, Johnny wants Stevie to call a plumber,1
296,TRAIN_0_296,Johnny," Yes, yes I do. I want you call... You should already be on the phone. Could you call a plumber?",,,0
297,TRAIN_0_297,Stevie," Let's see if he's home... or conscious. He's a good guy, he's just a big drinker.",,,0
298,TRAIN_0_298,Johnny, I also need a real estate agent. The name of a good real estate agent right away.,,,0
299,TRAIN_0_299,Stevie," Ooh, there's a guy named Ray. Yeah. He's the best one. He's also the only one so...",,,0
300,TRAIN_0_300,Johnny, A guy named Ray...,,,0
301,TRAIN_0_301,Stevie," Is there anything else I can help you with, Mr. Rose?",,,0
302,TRAIN_0_302,Johnny, Yes. My wife and I will be taking breakfast in our room this morning. Eggs florentine and a yoghurt parfait.,,,0
303,TRAIN_0_303,Stevie," Yeah... unfortunately, due to a lack of everything, we don't do room service. Uh, but you're always welcome to help yourself to our complimentary espresso bar. ",,,0
304,TRAIN_1_304,Johnny, I'd rather drink the pipe-water. ,SARCASTIC, Johnny would not rather drink the pipe water. He is saying that the coffee is likely terrible and he does not want any,1
305,TRAIN_0_305,Stevie, I hear ya.,,,0
306,TRAIN_0_306,Alexis, Ew! Who even is this girl? He said he'd never date someone with a toe ring and yet...,,,0
307,TRAIN_0_307,Moira, Rub my back.,,,0
308,TRAIN_0_308,David, What?! No.,,,0
309,TRAIN_0_309,Moira, I rubbed your back many a nights when you were little.,,,0
310,TRAIN_0_310,David," Yeah, in exchange for half my allowance.",,,0
311,TRAIN_0_311,Moira, Fine. You may select one silver piece from my accessory case. Right here.,,,0
312,TRAIN_0_312,Alexis, Omigod... she has hakuna matata tattooed on her foot.,,,0
313,TRAIN_0_313,David, Stavros was seeing escorts before you. A Disney tattoo shouldn't be a surprise.,,,0
314,TRAIN_0_314,Alexis, We said no social media post breakup. We had a pact about that.,,,0
315,TRAIN_0_315,David, He dates hooker.,,,0
316,TRAIN_1_316,Alexis," Oh, well, I'm sorry, I don't hire my friends at model castings. ",SARCASTIC," Alexis is saying that David has no real friends, that he instead hires them",1
317,TRAIN_0_317,Alexis," Actually, now that I think about in, where are those friends? ",,,0
318,TRAIN_0_318,David, They're just giving me space right now. Because they're considered people.,,,0
319,TRAIN_1_319,Alexis, Oh right. Space. Yeah. ,SARCASTIC, Alexis is saying that David’s friends are not actually his friends,1
320,TRAIN_0_320,David," Okay. Well, I think it's bests that he dumped you.",,,0
321,TRAIN_0_321,Alexis, He didn't dump me. We actually both decided that it was best that he see other people so... ,,,0
322,TRAIN_0_322,Moira," Children, mindless bickering is a luxury we may no longer afford. You are blind to reality and for that I am most proud but our worlds evil twin... has reared her ugly... ",,,0
323,TRAIN_0_323,David, Okay. I'm taking my journal into the bathroom. Where I will be shutting the door.,,,0
324,TRAIN_0_324,Moira, David! You might actually wanna hear this. ,,,0
325,TRAIN_0_325,Ray, Oh hi!,,,0
326,TRAIN_0_326,Johnny, Are you Ray?,,,0
327,TRAIN_0_327,Ray, Yes.,,,0
328,TRAIN_0_328,Johnny," You're late. Johnny Rose. My wife, Moira.",,,0
329,TRAIN_0_329,Moira, Hello.,,,0
330,TRAIN_0_330,Ray, Hi.,,,0
331,TRAIN_0_331,Moira," Oh, I love your complexion.",,,0
332,TRAIN_0_332,Ray," So... what can I help you with, housing, investment opportunities? ",,,0
333,TRAIN_0_333,Moira, Mr. Rose and I would like to put a for sale sign on this incredible town. ,,,0
334,TRAIN_0_334,Johnny," We're willing to settle for what we paid for it. More if you can get it, but definitely not less.",,,0
335,TRAIN_0_335,Ray," Well, I'm not gonna lie to you I'm not super optimistic. You know, because the government saw no value in Schitt's Creek.  You know, when they repossessed your assets.  You know, because of the humiliating...",,,0
336,TRAIN_0_336,Johnny," Yes, we know. We know. We know.",,,0
337,TRAIN_0_337,Ray," Well, we'll do our best. First we just have to get Roland to sign off on the listing and then we're good to go.",,,0
338,TRAIN_0_338,Moira, I need to confer with the financial powerhouse of the family. Since when did the mayor need to sign off on this?,,,0
339,TRAIN_0_339,Johnny," Ray, since when did the mayor need to sign off on this?",,,0
340,TRAIN_0_340,Ray," Well, it's all here...",,,0
341,TRAIN_0_341,Johnny, Son of a bitch!,,,0
342,TRAIN_0_342,David," Oh, excuse me. I don't think my sheets have been cleaned. They smell like cigarettes.",,,0
343,TRAIN_0_343,Stevie," No, that's just the way they smell. Also, you can tell your dad that the plumber was busy so I just pushed the bed against the wall and put down a bucket where the bed was. ",,,0
344,TRAIN_0_344,David," Okay. We're gonna be selling the town, so it'll be someone else's problem soon.",,,0
345,TRAIN_1_345,Stevie, But it's such a great place to live. ,SARCASTIC, Stevie thinks it is a terrible place to live,1
346,TRAIN_0_346,David, I think you're funny.,,,0
347,TRAIN_0_347,Stevie," Thank you. Um, look I know this probably isn't your thing, but there's a tailgate party later. It's not exactly clubbing but you know... close.",,,0
348,TRAIN_1_348,David, I don't even know what 'tailgate' means. In my mind I'm picturing like a Klan rally. ,SARCASTIC, David is joking about being in a small town with possibly a bunch of bigots,1
349,TRAIN_1_349,Stevie," Yeah, just fewer pointy hats. ",SARCASTIC, Stevie means that it is not like a Klan rally,1
350,TRAIN_0_350,Stevie, It's just townies with un-ironic haircuts.,,,0
351,TRAIN_0_351,David, Okay. I'm gonna pass I'm not really in the mood to be a victim of a hate crime tonight so...,,,0
352,TRAIN_0_352,Alexis, Okay. Stavros just posted three more photos. Who are these jenky women? ,,,0
353,TRAIN_0_353,David," Uh, from the looks of it they're blonde and mostly naked so... ",,,0
354,TRAIN_0_354,Alexis, Is there a bar in this place or are we in one of those religo cult towns? ,,,0
355,TRAIN_0_355,Stevie, I was just telling your brother about a party tonight. But he passed so... ,,,0
356,TRAIN_0_356,Alexis," Um, yes. Love that journey for me. Okay, so I'm looking for a guy like a mechanic or someone that hammers stuff. Um, at least 5'7. Kind of like full lips. Athletic body. Maybe a neck tattoo would be cute. ",,,0
357,TRAIN_0_357,David," No, it wouldn't. ",,,0
358,TRAIN_0_358,Alexis," You know, I think this could be really good for me. So thank you. ",,,0
359,TRAIN_0_359,Stevie, You're welcome. Yeah. I'm looking forward to it. Having all that fun. Wow. ,,,0
360,TRAIN_0_360,Roland," So Johnny Rose wants the ol' Johnny Hancock, huh? ",,,0
361,TRAIN_0_361,Johnny, Well... ,,,0
362,TRAIN_0_362,Roland," Shouldn't be a problem, Johnny. I'm happy to signoff on the listing. ",,,0
363,TRAIN_0_363,Johnny," Well, thank you, very much, Rolland, I appreciated. ",,,0
364,TRAIN_0_364,Roland, Sure. Why don't you come over tonight and pick it up. ,,,0
365,TRAIN_0_365,Johnny," Mr. Mayor, that's not necessary. No, no. Roland, a signature, that's all I need. ",,,0
366,TRAIN_0_366,Roland," Johnny look, here is what you're gonna do; you're gonna grab the kids, you're gonna grab Moira, you're gonna come over we're gonna sit down like civilized people, have a few laughs, and then at the end of the evening we'll get to the big signing, okay? ",,,0
367,TRAIN_0_367,Johnny," Right. Okay. Honestly Roland, it's just a, it's just a signature. A flick of the wrist. That's it. ",,,0
368,TRAIN_0_368,Roland," You're not rejecting my hospitality, are you, Johnny? Because that really wouldn't be a good way to start things off, I don't think.",,,0
369,TRAIN_1_369,Johnny," No, no. I'd love to come to dinner are you kidding me? ",RHETORICAL, Johnny is back-tracking and is trying to express his interest to attend dinner ,1
370,TRAIN_0_370,Johnny," No. I just thought, let's do business first, get the signature, and then dinner.",,,0
371,TRAIN_0_371,Roland," Johnny, you want that, to get that you need this. So let's just do this my way.",,,0
372,TRAIN_0_372,Johnny," Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, dinner is.",,,0
373,TRAIN_0_373,Roland," Dinner it is, atta boy. Okay.",,,0
374,TRAIN_1_374,Moira," How did you not get the contract signed, John? Can one thing, just one thing, not be easy in this town?! ",RHETORICAL, Moira finds that everything is a pain to take care of in the town,1
375,TRAIN_0_375,Johnny," Look Roland's playing games, honey, he's playing games. So this is something we have to do.",,,0
376,TRAIN_0_376,Alexis," Okay. Well, I would love to go, but I've actually double booked myself. I'm going to a truck party um, with the front desk girl and obviously she'd be super devastated if I bailed last minute. So I can't. I can't go.",,,0
377,TRAIN_0_377,Johnny," Okay. Well, cancel it because you're coming to dinner.",,,0
378,TRAIN_0_378,Alexis, No.,,,0
379,TRAIN_0_379,Johnny," One of you kids has to come. David, you've got nothing on tonight.",,,0
380,TRAIN_0_380,David, How... how do you know that.,,,0
381,TRAIN_0_381,Johnny, What do you have on tonight?,,,0
382,TRAIN_0_382,David, What?,,,0
383,TRAIN_0_383,Johnny," Good, it's settled.",,,0
384,TRAIN_0_384,Moira," Or you could go alone, John. Since you are the one who did not get the contract signed.",,,0
385,TRAIN_0_385,Johnny," Moira, Roland wants the family there tonight, so my family has to go tonight. Let me explain something about business.",,,0
386,TRAIN_0_386,Moira, Don't you dare... ,,,0
387,TRAIN_0_387,Johnny, It's a dance. And sometimes you lead. and sometimes you follow.,,,0
388,TRAIN_0_388,Moira," And which are you doing now, John?",,,0
389,TRAIN_0_389,Johnny," I am leading, Moira.",,,0
390,TRAIN_0_390,Moira, In a Roland game I think you're following.,,,0
391,TRAIN_0_391,Johnny," Following in the game but leading in the dance, right? And he thinks he's leading in the dance, but only because I've allowed him to think... ",,,0
392,TRAIN_0_392,Moira, Are you listening to this?,,,0
393,TRAIN_0_393,David, Hmm?,,,0
394,TRAIN_0_394,Johnny, It doesn't matter. I'm leading.,,,0
395,TRAIN_1_395,Moira," I'll shall bathe. And if I bang my head and slip beneath the surface, so be it, Mr. Rose. ",SARCASTIC, Moira is saying if she dies it is okay. She is being dramatic to make a point,1
396,TRAIN_0_396,Johnny, What's this?,,,0
397,TRAIN_0_397,David," Uh yeah, Stevie called. Apparently the plumber's in rehab. And you also... you have something on your...I don't know what that is but it's a thing.",,,0
398,TRAIN_0_398,Alexis," David, for the gate party tonight is it more of a leather pants thing or...",,,0
399,TRAIN_0_399,Johnny," Son of a bitch! Thanks for having us, Jocelyn. Thank you.",,,0
400,TRAIN_0_400,Jocelyn, Make yourselves at home. Roland is just on the toilet.,,,0
401,TRAIN_1_401,Johnny," Oh, what a surprise. ",SARCASTIC," Johnny is referring to Roland seemingly always being on the toilet, and so it is not a surprise",1
402,TRAIN_1_402,David," You have a really lovely home. It's really um, understated. ",SARCASTIC, David thinks it is busy,1
403,TRAIN_0_403,Jocelyn, Thank you. I get a lot of my ideas from magazines.,,,0
404,TRAIN_0_404,Moira, Don't be modest. This is 100 percent you and only you.,,,0
405,TRAIN_0_405,Roland," Hey, okay. It's the Roses. Come on, folks, please sit. Come on, I'm just the mayor for crying out loud. Ooh, hors d'oeuvres. Mmm. ",,,0
406,TRAIN_0_406,Jocelyn, That's too bad about Alexis.,,,0
407,TRAIN_0_407,Johnny," Well, it is. But we did bring the life of the party.",,,0
408,TRAIN_0_408,Moira, Our David.,,,0
409,TRAIN_0_409,Roland," Well, I guess, that just means there is more for you and me, right Dave?",,,0
410,TRAIN_0_410,Jocelyn, I hope everyone likes a cheeseball.,,,0
411,TRAIN_0_411,Johnny, Cheeseball? ,,,0
412,TRAIN_0_412,Jocelyn, It's the treat that keeps our love life percolating. It's like an aphrodisiac with him. Go ahead.,,,0
413,TRAIN_0_413,Johnny," Oh yes, can't wait. Can't wait. Mmm.",,,0
414,TRAIN_0_414,Jocelyn," So David, tell us about yourself I hear you're a gallerist.",,,0
415,TRAIN_0_415,Roland, Wow. There's a $10 dollar word.,,,0
416,TRAIN_0_416,Moira, David owned a brilliant gallery. Tell them about your last show.,,,0
417,TRAIN_0_417,David, It's not...,,,0
418,TRAIN_0_418,Moira," You must, please.",,,0
419,TRAIN_0_419,Johnny," Tell them, David, tell them.",,,0
420,TRAIN_0_420,David, The gallery worked with Janet Kempfluugen.,,,0
421,TRAIN_0_421,Johnny, Kempfluugen?,,,0
422,TRAIN_0_422,David," She's a Brooklyn based performance artist she's a big deal. Anyway um... she would walk into the space wearing a clay mask of a fawn, remove her clothing and breast feed members of the audience. It was a commentary on income inequality.",,,0
423,TRAIN_0_423,Roland, Wow...,,,0
424,TRAIN_0_424,Johnny, Heady stuff.,,,0
425,TRAIN_0_425,Roland," Well, hmm...",,,0
426,TRAIN_0_426,Alexis, Lip gloss? ,,,0
427,TRAIN_0_427,Stevie, No thank you.,,,0
428,TRAIN_0_428,Alexis," I wish I could pull off the whole gloomy, no makeup look. It's so French.",,,0
429,TRAIN_0_429,Stevie, Thank you.,,,0
430,TRAIN_0_430,Alexis," So, why are you single?",,,0
431,TRAIN_0_431,Stevie, Who said I'm single?,,,0
432,TRAIN_0_432,Alexis," Girl, we're on the hunt. I hope you're single.",,,0
433,TRAIN_0_433,Stevie," Oh, no. I'm not ""on the hunt"". A town this size, you've either been through 'em or know a little too much about 'em. ",,,0
434,TRAIN_0_434,Alexis, Hmm. Okay. I'm gonna go do a lap and this swan is best when she flies solo. So you're gonna be okay?,,,0
435,TRAIN_0_435,Stevie, I live here.,,,0
436,TRAIN_0_436,Alexis, Okay. Am I good?,,,0
437,TRAIN_0_437,Stevie, Hm-hm.,,,0
438,TRAIN_0_438,Alexis, Yes? Okay. Thank you.,,,0
439,TRAIN_0_439,Stevie," Are you not cold- Chuck, beer!",,,0
440,TRAIN_0_440,Roland," I know it's gotta be in here somewhere, slippery little b*st*rd.",,,0
441,TRAIN_0_441,Johnny," Maybe a fork would help, Roland?",,,0
442,TRAIN_0_442,Roland," Oh, that's sweet. Thank you. I'm okay. I'll find it.",,,0
443,TRAIN_0_443,Johnny," So is that the ah, contract over there?",,,0
444,TRAIN_0_444,Roland," Yeah, it is. You know, I gotta be honest with you, I tried reading that thing it is really boring. Ah, got it! There she is! Okay. Ohh! Oh my God, honey... oh, that is good. That is good.",,,0
445,TRAIN_0_445,Moira," I believe you were saying, John.",,,0
446,TRAIN_0_446,Johnny, Yes. This reminds me of a merger I put together in Zurich. It was two families breaking bread together. ,,,0
447,TRAIN_0_447,David, Ahh! Agh. My head. My head hurts.,,,0
448,TRAIN_0_448,Jocelyn, Oh no! Are you okay?,,,0
449,TRAIN_0_449,David," Um, it think it's the migraines that I get a lot. ",,,0
450,TRAIN_0_450,Johnny," Oh, I think... I think that'll pass, David. ",,,0
451,TRAIN_0_451,David, I don't think it's gonna pass. I don't think it's passing. ,,,0
452,TRAIN_0_452,Jocelyn, Migraines can be so awful.,,,0
453,TRAIN_0_453,Johnny," Yeah, well, not this one. Not this one.",,,0
454,TRAIN_0_454,David," Yeah, you know what? I... I think I need to go. ",,,0
455,TRAIN_0_455,Johnny, I think you need to eat something and that will help. ,,,0
456,TRAIN_0_456,David," No, I think I need to go back. ",,,0
457,TRAIN_0_457,Moira, Take me with you please. ,,,0
458,TRAIN_0_458,Johnny," David, sit down. Sit down. Sit back down. ",,,0
459,TRAIN_0_459,David," Jocelyn, thank you so much for dinner. ",,,0
460,TRAIN_0_460,Roland, Why don't you lay down on our mattress. The sheets are in the dryer but there is rubber pad. ,,,0
461,TRAIN_0_461,David, No. Thanks.,,,0
462,TRAIN_0_462,Johnny, David! Don't go near the door. David! Do not open that door.,,,0
463,TRAIN_0_463,Moira, I brought vodka as a house gift. I don't see it.,,,0
464,TRAIN_0_464,Alexis, That's what I say. Great.,,,0
465,TRAIN_0_465,Twyla, I'm Twyla from the cafe. ,,,0
466,TRAIN_0_466,David, Yeah. David Rose. ,,,0
467,TRAIN_0_467,Twyla, I'm a little drunk. ,,,0
468,TRAIN_0_468,David, Hm-hmm. ,,,0
469,TRAIN_0_469,Stevie, Hey. ,,,0
470,TRAIN_0_470,Twyla, Hey Stevie. I am going to roast myself a marshmallow. Anybody? ,,,0
471,TRAIN_0_471,Stevie, No. Thanks. ,,,0
472,TRAIN_0_472,Twyla, You're all good? ,,,0
473,TRAIN_0_473,David, No. ,,,0
474,TRAIN_0_474,Twyla, Great. ,,,0
475,TRAIN_0_475,Stevie, I don't know why you were so reluctant to show up here. You fit right in. ,,,0
476,TRAIN_0_476,David," Well, my sister texted me ""help"". And my mind went straight to deliverance. So I wasn't too far off. ",,,0
477,TRAIN_0_477,Stevie, That's funny because your sister texted me from across the bonfire and said you'd probably show up here because you were bored and lonely and had nothing better to do. ,,,0
478,TRAIN_0_478,David," Well, my sister is a broken shell of a human being. That's where that's coming from so...",,,0
479,TRAIN_0_479,Stevie," Oh, okay. Oh. Well, she seems fine. ",,,0
480,TRAIN_0_480,Alexis, Are you serious? That's so funny. That's so funny.,,,0
481,TRAIN_0_481,Stevie, So I guess you're free to go.,,,0
482,TRAIN_0_482,David, I'm gonna need a stiff drink to get through this. Stiff.,,,0
483,TRAIN_0_483,Moira," So Jocelyn, you were saying that you teach high school, or you want to finish high school? I'm not sure, I couldn't hear over your husband's chewing.",,,0
484,TRAIN_0_484,Jocelyn, I teach high school. ,,,0
485,TRAIN_0_485,Moira," Oh, you're a saint.",,,0
486,TRAIN_0_486,Jocelyn, I love it. I love connecting with the young people. Although I know those boys are undressing me every time I drop a piece of chalk. ,,,0
487,TRAIN_0_487,Roland," Yeah. Well, maybe we should hold onto our chalk, hmm? ",,,0
488,TRAIN_0_488,Jocelyn, They're boys! It's cute.,,,0
489,TRAIN_0_489,Moira,  John...,,,0
490,TRAIN_0_490,Roland," Oh, there it is! There it is! The Vivien Blake bitch face!",,,0
491,TRAIN_0_491,Moira, Excuse me?,,,0
492,TRAIN_0_492,Roland," I didn't want to say anything, but you were my favourite character on ""Sunrise Bay"".",,,0
493,TRAIN_0_493,Moira, Thanks.,,,0
494,TRAIN_0_494,Jocelyn," It's true. He lived for ""Sunrise Bay"". I could be doing cartwheels in a thong in front of that television, which I have done, but if your show was on, I was as good as wall paper. ",,,0
495,TRAIN_0_495,Roland," Hey, how many people did you slap on that show?",,,0
496,TRAIN_0_496,Moira, I don't care.,,,0
497,TRAIN_0_497,Johnny," She can't remember, there were so many slaps.",,,0
498,TRAIN_0_498,Moira, Enough about me. Let's talk about you signing this contract.,,,0
499,TRAIN_0_499,Roland," Well, somebody is in a little hurry, ain't she?",,,0
500,TRAIN_0_500,Johnny," No, no. We're not in a hurry. No.",,,0
501,TRAIN_0_501,Moira, Aren't we?,,,0
502,TRAIN_0_502,Johnny, No. We're not. No.,,,0
503,TRAIN_0_503,Moira, Really?,,,0
504,TRAIN_0_504,Roland," There it is again! Bam! Okay, I'll tell you what, Vivien...",,,0
505,TRAIN_0_505,Moira, Moira. ,,,0
506,TRAIN_0_506,Roland, I will go ahead and sign off on the sale... ,,,0
507,TRAIN_0_507,Moira, Good.,,,0
508,TRAIN_0_508,Roland, ... For a slap.,,,0
509,TRAIN_0_509,Moira, Excuse me? ,,,0
510,TRAIN_0_510,Roland, I've always wanted to be slapped by Vivien Blake.,,,0
511,TRAIN_0_511,Jocelyn," It's true. We've role-played it like a thousand times, but it's not the real thing.",,,0
512,TRAIN_0_512,Roland, Hm-hm.,,,0
513,TRAIN_0_513,Moira, You'd like me to slap you?,,,0
514,TRAIN_0_514,Roland, Yeah.,,,0
515,TRAIN_0_515,Moira, I don't think...,,,0
516,TRAIN_0_516,Roland," Well, don't think. Just do it. Slap me.",,,0
517,TRAIN_0_517,Johnny, He wants you to slap him.,,,0
518,TRAIN_0_518,Moira, I won't.,,,0
519,TRAIN_0_519,Jocelyn," Slap him, Moira.",,,0
520,TRAIN_0_520,Johnny, Go ahead and slap him.,,,0
521,TRAIN_0_521,Jocelyn," Slap my husband, Moira.",,,0
522,TRAIN_0_522,Moira," John, I won't!",,,0
523,TRAIN_0_523,Johnny, Slap him or I'll slap him.,,,0
524,TRAIN_0_524,Roland, Slap me!,,,0
525,TRAIN_0_525,Moira, I won't.,,,0
526,TRAIN_0_526,Roland, Slap me like a bitch!,,,0
527,TRAIN_0_527,Moira, Sign the f*cking contract!,,,0
528,TRAIN_0_528,Alexis," Okay. Um... this has been a lot of fun, but I'm starting to smell a little too much like uh, campfire, and denim and plaid and stuff so... bye. ",,,0
529,TRAIN_0_529,Stevie, Your choices are beer or beer.,,,0
530,TRAIN_0_530,David, I assume a pint glass is out of the question?,,,0
531,TRAIN_0_531,Alexis, You came! How was dinner?,,,0
532,TRAIN_0_532,David, Um... worse than this? Although at this point it's sort of a moving target. ,,,0
533,TRAIN_0_533,Stevie, Here hold this.,,,0
534,TRAIN_0_534,Alexis, So there are no guys for me here. But it was kind of nice to just like to flex the old muscle. ,,,0
535,TRAIN_0_535,Stevie, Put your thumb over the tube. ,,,0
536,TRAIN_0_536,Alexis," Agh, I kind of wanna just go for it but... But sometimes it doesn't work out, I guess.",,,0
537,TRAIN_0_537,David, Yeah.,,,0
538,TRAIN_0_538,Stevie," Okay, put the tube in your mouth.",,,0
539,TRAIN_0_539,David, What? Uh...,,,0
540,TRAIN_0_540,Stevie, Yeah. Just open your throat.,,,0
541,TRAIN_0_541,David, Oh.,,,0
542,TRAIN_0_542,Stevie," And go down, 'cause you're tall.",,,0
543,TRAIN_0_543,Alexis," Okay. David, how long are you gonna be doing this? Okay, just come and get me after you vomit, okay?",,,0
544,TRAIN_0_544,Stevie, Just open your throat!,,,0
545,TRAIN_0_545,Alexis, You!,,,0
546,TRAIN_0_546,Stevie, Chug!,,,0
547,TRAIN_0_547,Crowd, Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!,,,0

550,TRAIN_0_550,Alexis, Are you ready?,,,0
551,TRAIN_0_551,Roland," And that's the last one there! Done! Alrighty. There you go, Johnny, congratulations.",,,0
552,TRAIN_0_552,Johnny, Thank you very much. Thank you. ,,,0
553,TRAIN_0_553,Roland," Just remember one thing, okay? This is my town and you're gonna play by my rules. Comprende? I'm just messing with you, man! Come on!",,,0
554,TRAIN_0_554,Johnny, Wow.,,,0
555,TRAIN_0_555,Roland, Or am I? No. I am.,,,0
556,TRAIN_0_556,Johnny, Moira! Shall we?,,,0
557,TRAIN_0_557,Moira," Yeah. Jocelyn, thank you for an unforgettable evening, I will be dining out on this for years.",,,0
558,TRAIN_0_558,Jocelyn, I'll send you the recipes.,,,0
559,TRAIN_0_559,Johnny," Yes, Jocelyn, words can't express.",,,0
560,TRAIN_0_560,Roland," Seriously, Johnny, good luck selling the town. You sure gonna need it.",,,0
561,TRAIN_0_561,Johnny, Why's that?,,,0
562,TRAIN_0_562,Roland," Well, it took a while to sell the first time. I mean, it was on the market for like what 20 years before you bought it.",,,0
563,TRAIN_0_563,Johnny, 20 years?,,,0
564,TRAIN_0_564,Roland," Yeah. I mean, most people just thought it was a waste of money that it would never sell, you know? Who in their right mind would buy it! Then along came you.",,,0
565,TRAIN_0_565,Moira, John! Did you know this town was on the market for 20 years before we bought it?,,,0
566,TRAIN_0_566,Johnny," How would I know that? W... why would I know that? I didn't know that. But look, let's look at the bright side...",,,0
567,TRAIN_1_567,Moira," There is no bright side. This is the dark side of the moon, Johnny. And we'll be here another 20 years, tucked in a crater, lost to all. ",SARCASTIC, Moira is being dramatic. She is saying they will be stuck in the town forever,1
568,TRAIN_0_568,Johnny,"  Well, you know what? I think that's being a little dramatic.",,,0
569,TRAIN_0_569,Moira, Yes! It's dramatic! ,,,0
570,TRAIN_0_570,Johnny," Sweetheart! We got the thing signed, okay?! And if we have to fix this town up before we sell it, then we fix it up. We fix it up, bit by bit. And it's gonna take hard work but we can do it because we're Roses. And there is nothing we can't do...",,,0
571,TRAIN_0_571,Alexis, Hi... hi...,,,0
572,TRAIN_0_572,Alexis, You're being super loud right now.,,,0
573,TRAIN_0_573,David, I can hear you thought the headphones!,,,0
574,TRAIN_0_574,Alexis, So if you can just wrap it up in here.,,,0
575,TRAIN_0_575,David, 10 to a 5. Thanks.,,,0
576,TRAIN_0_576,Moira, Night Night.,,,0
577,TRAIN_0_577,Johnny, I feel good about this. I really do.,,,0
578,TRAIN_0_578,Johnny," So, this is the town limits?",,,0
579,TRAIN_0_579,Ray," Yes sir, 4,500 acres that ends right here at the town sign. And it's all yours, Johnny, it must be a nice feeling, considering you don't have a lot right now. You know, because of the crooked business manager. You know, the money scandal...",,,0
580,TRAIN_0_580,Johnny," Yes, I know, I know, I know, Ray. What the hell is this?!",,,0
581,TRAIN_0_581,Ray, The town sign.,,,0
582,TRAIN_0_582,Johnny," Is this the real sign, or the joke sign?",,,0
583,TRAIN_0_583,Ray, What do you mean?,,,0
584,TRAIN_0_584,Johnny," You don't see anything wrong with this? The man! Standing awfully close to that woman, wouldn't you say?",,,0
585,TRAIN_0_585,Ray," Well, he's holding on to her so she doesn't fall into the creek.",,,0
586,TRAIN_0_586,Johnny," Look a little closer, Ray.",,,0
587,TRAIN_0_587,Ray," Well, it need a little sprucing up.",,,0
588,TRAIN_0_588,Johnny, Sprucing up?!,,,0
589,TRAIN_0_589,Ray," It's very popular, people come from all over to take a picture with it.",,,0
590,TRAIN_0_590,Johnny, I'll bet they do! You know what? This is coming down!,,,0
591,TRAIN_0_591,Ray, That's the mayor's family up there! The sign's been here over forty years.,,,0
592,TRAIN_0_592,Johnny, And you wonder why this place won't sell? ,,,0
593,TRAIN_0_593,Ray," Oh, I think I see it now. His shoulders are too big.",,,0
594,TRAIN_0_594,Johnny," Get in the car, Ray. Moira? Boy, we've got our work cut out for us. But I've seen worse. It's not a problem. Moira?",,,0
595,TRAIN_0_595,Moira,"  They dare to call me irrelevant? Shag carpeting, that's irrelevant! L.A. is irrelevant... I am relevant! ""Good riddance,"" is what they said.",,,0
596,TRAIN_0_596,Johnny," Oh, who said that, sweetheart?",,,0
597,TRAIN_0_597,Moira, I don't know! They're no name commentors. Tormentors.,,,0
598,TRAIN_0_598,Johnny," Are we having a bad day, honey?",,,0
599,TRAIN_0_599,Moira," Anonymous. Ominous. That'll be fine, thank you. I'm afraid I don't have a gratuity right now. ",,,0
600,TRAIN_0_600,Alexis," So, that guy from the other night. He's not for me, right?",,,0
601,TRAIN_0_601,David, What guy?,,,0
602,TRAIN_0_602,Alexis," That beardy guy that I kissed at the party. He's gross, right? Like, that's not a thing for me.  There wasn't like, a spark or anything.",,,0
603,TRAIN_0_603,David, You mean the hitchhiker that was burning meat over a garbage can?,,,0
604,TRAIN_0_604,Alexis," Yeah, that one.",,,0
605,TRAIN_0_605,Johnny, Have you seen your mother today?,,,0
606,TRAIN_0_606,Alexis," Um yeah, she was face down on the carpet before dragging herself into the closet.",,,0
607,TRAIN_0_607,Johnny, And you didn't say anything?!,,,0
608,TRAIN_0_608,Alexis, I thought she was maybe looking for a contact or something.,,,0
609,TRAIN_0_609,Johnny," Yeah, she googled herself again, now she's having one of her ""things.""",,,0
610,TRAIN_0_610,David, How bad is it?,,,0
611,TRAIN_0_611,Johnny, How bad is it? A solid seven.,,,0
612,TRAIN_0_612,David," It's not an eight, which seems manageable for you.",,,0
613,TRAIN_0_613,Johnny," Well, except I've got a few things I have to take care of, so I need you two to go in, and take...",,,0
614,TRAIN_0_614,Alexis," No, I did Saint-Tropez, so.",,,0
615,TRAIN_0_615,David," And I did her birthday, and Aspen twice.",,,0
616,TRAIN_0_616,Johnny," And I'm trying to sell this town. So, if you kids want any chance of getting out of here, you'll help me out, and go in and look after your mother! Alexis"," Well, my horoscope said that I shouldn't assume responsibility for anybody but myself today. ",,0
617,TRAIN_1_617,Johnny," Yeah, and my horoscope says, why don't you go in and help your mother! ",SARCASTIC, Johnny did not read his horoscope. He mocking Alexis while also trying to get her to help her mother,1
618,TRAIN_0_618,Johnny," And don't let her out of your sight, okay? We don't want her detonating in public!",,,0
619,TRAIN_0_619,Alexis," I know! Though it is kind of fun to watch, though.",,,0
620,TRAIN_0_620,Johnny, Not when you're the one she's trying to back over with a car. What's that?,,,0
621,TRAIN_0_621,David, Eye cream.,,,0
622,TRAIN_0_622,Johnny, From where?,,,0
623,TRAIN_0_623,David, From Paris. ,,,0
624,TRAIN_0_624,Johnny, How did you pay for it?,,,0
625,TRAIN_0_625,David," Oh, one of my credit cards is still working.",,,0
626,TRAIN_0_626,Johnny," Oh, you're charging things to your credit card?! I see, and how are you gonna pay for it?",,,0
627,TRAIN_0_627,David," I don't think you understand, I already have it.",,,0
628,TRAIN_0_628,Johnny," Well, I know this is a bizarre concept for you, David, but if you want cream from Paris, you need a job, so you can pay for the cream from Paris! ",,,0
629,TRAIN_1_629,David," Okay well, tell that to the bags under my eyes, then. ",SARCASTIC, David doesn’t want Johnny to talk to the bags under his eyes. He is saying that he needs the cream to fix the bags under his eyes,1
630,TRAIN_0_630,Johnny," And right after you tell your next joke, I want you to go down to the front desk, and ask what's-her-name...",,,0
631,TRAIN_0_631,David, Stevie.,,,0
632,TRAIN_0_632,Johnny," Where you can get a job around here! All right? I'm in the middle getting rid of an x-rated sign, before it scares off the few buyers we might actually have!",,,0
633,TRAIN_1_633,David," Okay, I'll get on that. ",SARCASTIC, David is not planning to get a job,1
634,TRAIN_0_634,Johnny," You want the smooth under eyes of a 16-year-old, get a job!",,,0
635,TRAIN_0_635,Alexis," You just need to relax, because it's not like your boyfriend left you for a Scandinavian flight attendant! What kind of name is Kika anyway? I'm the one that should be in the closet right now, not you.",,,0
636,TRAIN_0_636,Moira, Help me out. Help me!,,,0
637,TRAIN_0_637,Alexis, Okay!,,,0
638,TRAIN_0_638,Moira," Oh, shhh! My foot's fallen asleep. Hey, shall we see what they're saying about you and Stavros?",,,0
639,TRAIN_0_639,Alexis, No! ,,,0
640,TRAIN_0_640,Moira, It's not my idea!,,,0
641,TRAIN_0_641,Moira, You were a couple of doe eyed lovers aboard a trans-Atlantic airship filled with gas!,,,0
642,TRAIN_0_642,Alexis," You know what I think we should do? I think we should go get something to eat, because when you're eating you can't be talking to me, okay?",,,0
643,TRAIN_0_643,Moira, You know what I think?,,,0
644,TRAIN_0_644,Alexis, What? ,,,0
645,TRAIN_0_645,Moira, You date pigs.,,,0
646,TRAIN_0_646,Alexis," Okay, I just remembered that being a mother is not your strong suit. ",,,0
647,TRAIN_0_647,Moira," Oh darling, I'm only telling you because it's true! ",,,0
648,TRAIN_1_648,Alexis, And because you gobbled down a hundred thousand anti-depressants this morning. ,SARCASTIC," Moira had a few anti-depressants, but she did not have 100. Alexis is exaggerating",1
649,TRAIN_0_649,Moira, I was hungry! But I could still eat.,,,0
650,TRAIN_0_650,David," Hi, um... question. If one were to theoretically look for a job here in Schitt's Creek, where would you... suggest that that person go to look? Is there, like, a bulletin board or a pamphlet, or something with information on it?",,,0
651,TRAIN_0_651,Stevie," No, no bulletin board... What kind of job are you looking for? ",,,0
652,TRAIN_0_652,David," Um, something in like, art curating, or trend forecasting.",,,0
653,TRAIN_1_653,Stevie," Oh, okay... um, hmmm, let's see. Not seeing anything in art curating, or trend forecasting, that's weird. ",SARCASTIC, Those are very specific jobs that have no demand in Schitt’s Creek,1
654,TRAIN_0_654,David, Okay.,,,0
655,TRAIN_0_655,Stevie," Um, do you have any other skills or areas of expertise?",,,0
656,TRAIN_0_656,David, I've been told I have really good taste.,,,0
657,TRAIN_1_657,Stevie," Oh, well, that's good. ",SARCASTIC, Stevie is saying that is not helpful information,1
658,TRAIN_0_658,"Um, let's see... Oh! Bag boy at the grocery store.",,,,0
659,TRAIN_0_659,David, I don't know what that is.,,,0
660,TRAIN_0_660,Stevie," You put groceries in bags, so that people can carry their groceries out of the grocery store. ",,,0
661,TRAIN_0_661,David," Okay, and how much do you think that would pay?",,,0
662,TRAIN_0_662,Stevie," Mmm, I'm gonna say minimum wage.",,,0
663,TRAIN_0_663,David," Which is what, forty, forty-five something an hour?",,,0
664,TRAIN_1_664,Stevie," Mmm-hmm, exactly. ",SARCASTIC, Minimum wage is maybe $10,1
665,TRAIN_0_665,David," Okay. Okay! Um, well, something to think about. For sure, thank you.",,,0
666,TRAIN_0_666,Stevie, You're welcome.,,,0
667,TRAIN_0_667,Moira," I would like two apple fritters, sliver of pecan pie, large fries with gravy and bacon!",,,0
668,TRAIN_0_668,Alexis," Okay, so, she will have scrambled egg whites and some steamed spinach, please, thank you. ",,,0
669,TRAIN_0_669,Moira," And some pecan pie! Onion rings, and ice cream! ",,,0
670,TRAIN_0_670,Alexis," Actually, none of that, and I will have a tea, thank you. Okay.",,,0
671,TRAIN_0_671,Twyla," Um, Mrs. Rose, are you okay? You seem a bit... ",,,0
672,TRAIN_0_672,Alexis," Mm-hmm, she's fine. ",,,0
673,TRAIN_0_673,Moira, I'm fine.,,,0
674,TRAIN_0_674,Alexis," Um... Hey! Stay here, okay? Don't move!",,,0
675,TRAIN_0_675,Moira," Oh wow, I'm really bored.",,,0
676,TRAIN_0_676,Alexis," Hey! Hey! Hey you! Hey! Hey, so I just wanted to be clear about what happened the other night. The reason that I let you kiss me. ",,,0
677,TRAIN_0_677,Mutt," Um, you kissed me.",,,0
678,TRAIN_0_678,Alexis," Yeah, no, I can see how that would be confusing, but I just wanted to let you know that that was just me going through some stuff. ",,,0
679,TRAIN_0_679,Mutt, Cool.,,,0
680,TRAIN_0_680,Alexis," Um, hey! So, why do they give you table scraps? Are you, like, a poor person, or?",,,0
681,TRAIN_0_681,Mutt," Uh, no, but thanks for asking. No, I use it to compost.  You know, that way nothing gets thrown out. Composting?",,,0
682,TRAIN_0_682,Alexis," Yeah, no, I... I know composting. Um, Gwyneth Paltrow does a compost gift exchange.",,,0
683,TRAIN_0_683,Mutt, I'm gonna go. ,,,0
684,TRAIN_0_684,Alexis," Okay, great, I'm glad that we could clear this up. ",,,0

691,TRAIN_0_691,Ray, I told you he wouldn't let this go!,,,0
692,TRAIN_0_692,Bob, The sign tells people what to expect when they're in town. Do you have a problem with that message?,,,0
693,TRAIN_0_693,Johnny," A major problem, Bob. Yeah, you see, it's the first thing you see when you drive in, and as the owner of the town, I'd like to convey a better, cleaner image.",,,0
694,TRAIN_0_694,Bob," There's a lot of history in that sign, Johnny. Schitt history.",,,0
695,TRAIN_0_695,Ronnie," That's all we need, some outsider coming in here and changing everything. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!",,,0

699,TRAIN_1_699,Moira," I'm eating egg whites, and hoping the building will collapse. ",SARCASTIC," Moira is being dramatic, saying she wants to die. She does not want to die",1
700,TRAIN_0_700,Jocelyn," Anyways, I have a giant favour. My class is putting on a play for the younger grades, and I just... thought that you'd be perfect, you know, to help coach the kids. Because they'd be thrilled to have someone like you, an actual star... teach them?",,,0
701,TRAIN_0_701,Moira," That must have taken such courage to ask me that. But in show business boldness is rewarded, so my answer is yes. Yes, yes!",,,0
702,TRAIN_0_702,Jocelyn, That is such good news!,,,0
703,TRAIN_0_703,Moira," , I know!",,,0
704,TRAIN_0_704,Johnny," So, how'd it go?",,,0

710,TRAIN_0_710,Johnny," Well, the interview's where you make your first good impression, so, it's gotta count.",,,0
711,TRAIN_0_711,David," I'm interviewing to be a bag boy, not a personal injury lawyer.",,,0

725,TRAIN_0_725,David, Okay...,,,0
726,TRAIN_0_726,Johnny," And look at how you're dressed! What is this?! Colostomy bag pants! I'm the manager of a family run grocery store. I'm not gonna hire you! You're not gonna get the job, you're the last person... ",,,0
727,TRAIN_0_727,David, Okay!,,,0

740,TRAIN_0_740,Moira," Okay, how many of you beautiful young things have a background in the theater? Raise your swords! I see, a class grounded in realism, nice work. Because that is where we find our deepest well.  May I be up front?",,,0
741,TRAIN_0_741,Jocelyn, Yes.,,,0
742,TRAIN_0_742,Moira," We're not here to play, or to have fun! You will work until it hurts!",,,0

744,TRAIN_0_744,Johnny," Hey, just the man I wanna see!",,,0
745,TRAIN_0_745,Roland," So word on the street is that you're all freaked out about the town sign, is that right? ",,,0

756,TRAIN_0_756,Moira," Okay, stop! No one speak. Not a word! It's not your fault, the script is garbage! Okay, which one of you wrote this?",,,0
757,TRAIN_0_757,Jocelyn, I did.,,,0

759,TRAIN_0_759,Jocelyn, No! ,,,0
760,TRAIN_0_760,Moira," Then write what you know, okay? The quiet suffering of a woman trapped in a relationship with a simpleton. ",,,0
761,TRAIN_0_761,Jocelyn," That's not what I know Moira, and drug awareness is part of the curriculum, so. ",,,0
762,TRAIN_0_762,Moira, I'm gonna work with these two. What is it that you want?,,,0
763,TRAIN_0_763,Kid1, To go home.,,,0

792,TRAIN_0_792,Johnny, You can't tell me you don't see that!,,,0
793,TRAIN_0_793,Roland," Well, you know, now that you put that creepy thought in my head, sure, I... I see it, but you got it all wrong, pal! Let me enlighten you, Mr. Johnny Rose! That isn't even Horace's wife! That's his sister.",,,0
794,TRAIN_0_794,Johnny," Well, how does that make it any better?",,,0

917,TRAIN_0_917,David," Yeah, no, no, no. I'm just trying to figure out... What about this... What about this is funky? I'm just having a hard time understanding.",,,0
918,TRAIN_0_918,Stevie," It's just, you know, like funky. Different.",,,0
919,TRAIN_0_919,David," Yeah, funky is a neon t-shirt you buy at an airport gift shop, next to a bejeweled iPhone case. This... this... is luxury.",,,0
920,TRAIN_0_920,Stevie, There's a lot of stuff here. Have you ever considered selling some of this.,,,0
921,TRAIN_0_921,David, These are my things. I've hand-selected each of these things; they mean a lot to me. How much do you think I can get for this?,,,0
922,TRAIN_0_922,Alexis, So you got busted for selling drugs? Like hard drugs? Like... Did you wear a Hazmat suit and... work in a trailer?,,,0
923,TRAIN_0_923,Mutt," No. It was just weed and mushrooms, uppers. Mostly to truckers and my high school teachers.",,,0
924,TRAIN_0_924,Alexis," Mm-hmm. It's actually pretty clean around here, which is shocking considering the state of our motel room. Speaking of unfit homes, why do you live in a barn?",,,0
925,TRAIN_0_925,Mutt, What's wrong with living in a barn?,,,0
926,TRAIN_1_926,Alexis," Mm... nothing, if you're a goat. ",SARCASTIC," Alexis means that people should not live in barns, but farm animals should",1
927,TRAIN_0_927,Mutt," Well, it serves its purpose. ",,,0
928,TRAIN_1_928,Alexis, It seems to... With the ladies. ,SARCASTIC, Alexis means that Mutt uses the barn to seduce women,1
929,TRAIN_0_929,Alexis,That's just a joke. I'm sorry for walking in on you and Twyla the other day. ,,,0
930,TRAIN_0_930,Mutt," No, it's cool.",,,0
931,TRAIN_0_931,Alexis, So how long have you two been together- ,,,0
932,TRAIN_0_932,Mutt," So, listen, I gotta take off for a bit. I got this thing I gotta do. Can you cover for me? ",,,0
933,TRAIN_0_933,Alexis, Um... I mean...,,,0
934,TRAIN_0_934,Mutt, Cool.,,,0
935,TRAIN_0_935,Alexis, Yeah.,,,0
936,TRAIN_0_936,Mutt, Thanks. Sorry.,,,0
937,TRAIN_0_937,Alexis, Excuse me! What am I supposed to keep doing here?,,,0
938,TRAIN_0_938,David," I feel like we should break these into categories. Um... fit, fabric, and nationality.",,,0
939,TRAIN_0_939,Stevie, Or we could do this.,,,0
940,TRAIN_0_940,David, I... um...,,,0
941,TRAIN_0_941,Stevie, Keep or sell?,,,0
942,TRAIN_0_942,David," Well, those are-",,,0
943,TRAIN_0_943,Stevie, Keep or sell.,,,0
944,TRAIN_0_944,David, Uh...,,,0
945,TRAIN_0_945,Stevie, Just keep or sell.,,,0
946,TRAIN_0_946,David, Sell. Sell them. I got these at a showroom in Paris.,,,0
947,TRAIN_0_947,Stevie, I got these on clearance rack at Target.,,,0
948,TRAIN_0_948,David,$850.00 ,,,0
949,TRAIN_0_949,Stevie, 850 what?,,,0
950,TRAIN_0_950,David, Eight hundred-,,,0
951,TRAIN_0_951,Stevie, Dollars?!,,,0
952,TRAIN_0_952,David, $850 dollars. ,,,0
953,TRAIN_0_953,Stevie, $850 dollars?,,,0
954,TRAIN_0_954,David," These are a collector's. There's a woman in Paris that makes them by hand, so...",,,0
955,TRAIN_0_955,Stevie, My car's worth less than your pants.,,,0
956,TRAIN_0_956,David," Well, I've seen your car and that makes sense to me.",,,0
957,TRAIN_1_957,Stevie, Okay then. Right. We'll try to get $850 dollars for your pants. ,SARCASTIC, Stevie knows that they will not be able to sell David’s pants for $850 Keep or sell?,1
958,TRAIN_0_958,David, I don't know.,,,0
959,TRAIN_0_959,Alexis, Oh...,,,0
960,TRAIN_0_960,Johnny," You know, I think the reason our kids are so casual with us is because they think of us as their friends. ",,,0
961,TRAIN_0_961,Moira," Hmm, no.",,,0
962,TRAIN_0_962,Johnny," No, it's obvious. It's obvious, Moira, right? Because we're hip parents.",,,0
963,TRAIN_0_963,Moira," Oh, John...",,,0
964,TRAIN_0_964,Johnny, And that comes at a price.,,,0
965,TRAIN_0_965,Moira," John, we're not hip. I'm hipper than you but in our childrens' eyes we are the polar antonym of hip.",,,0
966,TRAIN_0_966,Johnny," Well, somehow we've lost touch with our kids. We've become complete strangers.",,,0
967,TRAIN_0_967,Twyla, Hey! Have we decided?,,,0
968,TRAIN_0_968,Moira," Just coffee, please. ",,,0
969,TRAIN_0_969,Johnny," Uh... Twyla, do you get along with your parents?",,,0
970,TRAIN_0_970,Twyla, I did. It's a little different now. My mom has this thing where half the time she thinks I'm her cousin Angela. And it's getting harder and harder to coordinate visitation times with my dad in prison. ,,,0
971,TRAIN_0_971,Johnny, I'm sorry I asked. ,,,0
972,TRAIN_0_972,Twyla," Oh, that's okay! I'll get you your coffees.",,,0
973,TRAIN_0_973,Johnny, Your mother and I have been talking and we've come to the realization that we've not been very good parents. ,,,0
974,TRAIN_0_974,Moira," Sadly, and most of the time, we have no interest in what's going on with you. ",,,0
975,TRAIN_0_975,Johnny," We have no idea what. 'Cause she means no idea. We have lost touch as a family and if we're gonna get through this ordeal together, we have got to get reacquainted. Now, back at Rose Video, we had management retreats where we would play fun team-building exercises- ",,,0
976,TRAIN_1_976,David, You also had company-wide spa days. Why don't we try that? ,RHETORICAL, David knows that they can’t afford a spa day. But he does not want to play team-building games,1
977,TRAIN_0_977,Johnny," And one of the ice breakers at these retreats was a game that was always a hit.  And it was a game where somebody would tell a lie about themselves, and then a truth, and then another lie, and everybody would have to guess which one was the lie. ",,,0
978,TRAIN_0_978,Moira," No, Johnny, they had to guess which one was the truth. ",,,0
979,TRAIN_0_979,Johnny, Mm... which one was the lie.,,,0
980,TRAIN_0_980,David, It's just-it's just one lie.,,,0
981,TRAIN_0_981,Johnny, What did I say? ,,,0
982,TRAIN_0_982,Alexis, You said two lies. ,,,0
983,TRAIN_0_983,Johnny," Well, it is two lies. ",,,0
984,TRAIN_0_984,Alexis," No, it's- ",,,0
985,TRAIN_0_985,David," No, the game is ""two truths and a lie.""",,,0
986,TRAIN_0_986,Johnny, It's truth.,,,0
987,TRAIN_0_987,David, That's the game.,,,0
988,TRAIN_0_988,Johnny, So you've heard of it. You've heard of it.,,,0
989,TRAIN_0_989,Alexis," Well, yeah, because babies play that at their birthday parties. ",,,0
990,TRAIN_0_990,Johnny," Okay, whatever. It's a good game. Okay? Now, here's how it goes. I'll give you an example.",,,0
991,TRAIN_1_991,David," Why don't I start? Um, I'm miserable, drunk, and hate this game. So... here's a hint... Sadly, I'm not drunk. ",SARCASTIC, David is not sad he’s not drunk. He’s being dramatic,1
992,TRAIN_0_992,Johnny," Okay, wrong attitude. That's the wrong-right off the top!",,,0
993,TRAIN_0_993,Alexis," Okay, my turn, my turn, my turn. Um... okay. My eyes are brown, I am basically sample-sized, and one time I escaped from a Thai drug lord's car trunk by bribing him with s*x. ",,,0
994,TRAIN_0_994,Johnny," Right idea, honey, but you know what? It's gotta be more challenging for everybody-",,,0
995,TRAIN_0_995,Moira, Her eyes are aqua.,,,0
996,TRAIN_0_996,Johnny, You did what?,,,0
997,TRAIN_0_997,Alexis, I'm kidding! I clearly would never bribe anybody with s*x.,,,0
998,TRAIN_0_998,Johnny, When were you in Thailand?!,,,0
999,TRAIN_0_999,Alexis, I told you that I was on spring break. Everyone can just calm down because Aroon was a lovely gentleman until he ran out of money.,,,0
1000,TRAIN_1_1000,David, How many people do you know that are currently in the prison system? Is it like twelve...? ,SARCASTIC," David is pointing out that many of Alexis’s acquaintances are criminals, but he does not want to know exactly how many are in the prison system",1
1001,TRAIN_0_1001,Alexis," Um, I'm pretty sure just two. ",,,0
1002,TRAIN_0_1002,Johnny," All right, that's enough. Good game. Good game, everybody! Alexis you're grounded.",,,0
1003,TRAIN_0_1003,Alexis," No! That was ten years ago, and everybody does dumb stuff in high school.",,,0
1004,TRAIN_0_1004,Johnny, You were 17?! Did you know this? ,,,0
1005,TRAIN_0_1005,Moira, As if. I don't do girl talk. ,,,0
1006,TRAIN_0_1006,Alexis," Okay, everybody does dumb stuff everywhere.  For example, I saw Mutt today - the guy that lives in the barn - making out... with the mayor's wife. ",,,0
1007,TRAIN_0_1007,Moira, What's-her-face?! ,,,0
1008,TRAIN_0_1008,Alexis, Mm-hmm. ,,,0
1009,TRAIN_0_1009,Johnny, And the homeless kid? ,,,0
1010,TRAIN_0_1010,Alexis, Mm-hmm. Guys like that will bone anything. ,,,0
1011,TRAIN_0_1011,David," Well, not anything. ",,,0
1012,TRAIN_0_1012,Alexis, Stop. ,,,0
1013,TRAIN_0_1013,David, 'Cause that would mean... ,,,0
1014,TRAIN_0_1014,Alexis, Stop. Stop. ,,,0
1015,TRAIN_0_1015,David, That would include... ,,,0
1016,TRAIN_0_1016,Alexis, Stop it. ,,,0
1017,TRAIN_0_1017,David, You. Which it doesn't. ,,,0
1018,TRAIN_0_1018,Alexis, Don't. ,,,0
1019,TRAIN_0_1019,Moira, Ew. ,,,0
1020,TRAIN_0_1020,Johnny," You know, I remember when Alexis was just a chubby-faced little girl racing around the house in that banned babywalker, and now she's spending time... In a drug lord's trunk?!",,,0
1021,TRAIN_0_1021,Twyla," Oh, that is my favourite Liam Neeson movie. ",,,0
1022,TRAIN_0_1022,Moira," Johnny. Johnny, look who's come in.",,,0
1023,TRAIN_0_1023,Johnny, Is it true?,,,0
1024,TRAIN_0_1024,Moira, Politician's neglected wife sleeps with a ranch hand. I love it.,,,0
1025,TRAIN_0_1025,Johnny, He's not a ranch hand. He's a vagrant in a barn.,,,0
1026,TRAIN_0_1026,Moira, Hi there!,,,0
1027,TRAIN_0_1027,Jocelyn, Moira. ,,,0
1028,TRAIN_0_1028,Johnny, Jocelyn. Hi.,,,0
1029,TRAIN_0_1029,Jocelyn," Johnny, hi.",,,0
1030,TRAIN_0_1030,Moira, You look amazing. Utterly alive.,,,0
1031,TRAIN_0_1031,Jocelyn, I don't feel it. My lower back is completely shot.,,,0
1032,TRAIN_0_1032,Moira," Oh, dear. Why would that be?",,,0
1033,TRAIN_0_1033,Jocelyn, Age? Even the slightest twitch in bed throws it out.,,,0
1034,TRAIN_0_1034,Moira, Perhaps a new position would help? Would like to join us?,,,0
1035,TRAIN_0_1035,Jocelyn," No, I ate already. Couldn't put another thing in my mouth.",,,0
1036,TRAIN_0_1036,Johnny," Well, that's...",,,0
1037,TRAIN_0_1037,Moira, Okay. All right then.,,,0
1038,TRAIN_0_1038,David, Oh my God.,,,0
1039,TRAIN_0_1039,Stevie," They sell all kinds of stuff. Hey, Wayne.",,,0
1040,TRAIN_0_1040,Wayne," Hey, Stevie.",,,0
1041,TRAIN_0_1041,Stevie, Um... so this is my friend David.,,,0
1042,TRAIN_0_1042,David, David Rose. What are your consignment percentages?,,,0
1043,TRAIN_0_1043,Stevie," Uh, this is a thrift shop.",,,0
1044,TRAIN_0_1044,David, Okay. Do you have sales representative? Who will be pricing these items?,,,0
1045,TRAIN_0_1045,Wayne, Uh... me.,,,0
1046,TRAIN_0_1046,David," Okay. Is there a problem, Wayne?",,,0
1047,TRAIN_0_1047,Wayne," It's just... I can't really use any of this. It's too, you know...",,,0
1048,TRAIN_0_1048,Stevie, Funky?,,,0
1049,TRAIN_1_1049,Wayne, Sure. Let's go with that. ,SARCASTIC," Wayne doesn’t like the stuff, but doesn’t want to be rude, so he agrees with Stevie’s word of “funky.”",1
1050,TRAIN_0_1050,David," Okay, let's take your oily hands off my clothes. ",,,0
1051,TRAIN_0_1051,Stevie, You sure you can't take any of this stuff? Some of this stuff's pretty good. ,,,0
1052,TRAIN_0_1052,Wayne, Um... maybe we can use the sneakers.,,,0
1053,TRAIN_0_1053,David," Maybe the sneakers? This is French suede, with a vulcanized-rubber instep, okay? You've lost my trust and my business, so... We'll be leaving now.",,,0
1054,TRAIN_0_1054,Stevie, Sorry.,,,0
1055,TRAIN_1_1055,David, What is this place? What is this place?! ,RHETORICAL, David knows it is a thrift store. He is communicating his distain for the place to Stevie,1
1056,TRAIN_0_1056,Alexis, Ha! Ugh!,,,0
1057,TRAIN_0_1057,Mutt, So... what happened to you yesterday?,,,0
1058,TRAIN_0_1058,Alexis, What happened to me?,,,0
1059,TRAIN_0_1059,Mutt," Yeah, I came back you were gone.",,,0
1060,TRAIN_0_1060,Alexis," Well, I had to do most of the shift by myself. So thank God I had my rape whistle.",,,0
1061,TRAIN_0_1061,Mutt, Sorry. I had some stuff I had to take care of.,,,0
1062,TRAIN_0_1062,Alexis, And did you get your stuff taken care of?,,,0
1063,TRAIN_0_1063,Mutt," Yeah, I guess.",,,0
1064,TRAIN_0_1064,Alexis," 'Cause it... It seems to me like you get your stuff taken care of pretty regularly. By multiple people, if you know what I mean.",,,0
1065,TRAIN_0_1065,Mutt, I don't.,,,0
1066,TRAIN_0_1066,Alexis," Look, I know you probably think that you're this handsome man around town who's like... Handsome, mysterious... And handsome and homeless-y but you're better than that, you know? ",,,0
1067,TRAIN_0_1067,Mutt, What?,,,0
1068,TRAIN_0_1068,Alexis," Like, I don't judge. Trust me. I have been... I have been in the middle of some very messy group scenarios and I know how weird it can be, so... Mutt", Are you okay? ,,0
1069,TRAIN_0_1069,Alexis, Yeah. I'm just saying that your secret is safe with me. Wink.,,,0
1070,TRAIN_0_1070,Moira," Let me just say, I get it. How much can one person take?",,,0
1071,TRAIN_0_1071,Johnny," Well, may-maybe this is not our place, Moira.",,,0
1072,TRAIN_0_1072,Moira, And where does all that pent up energy go?,,,0
1073,TRAIN_0_1073,Jocelyn, I should go.,,,0
1074,TRAIN_0_1074,Roland, Hey...,,,0
1075,TRAIN_0_1075,Jocelyn, Hey.,,,0
1076,TRAIN_0_1076,Roland, Where have you been? I've been looking for you all morning.,,,0
1077,TRAIN_0_1077,Jocelyn, Around. Doing stuff.,,,0
1078,TRAIN_0_1078,Roland," Well, I tried calling you.",,,0
1079,TRAIN_0_1079,Jocelyn, I must have turned my phone off by mistake.,,,0
1080,TRAIN_0_1080,Roland," Joce, did you see him again today?",,,0
1081,TRAIN_0_1081,Jocelyn, See who?,,,0
1082,TRAIN_0_1082,Roland," Oh, geez, you know I told you, you can see him as much as you want, just don't keep it a secret from me, okay? I wanna know everything you two are doing.",,,0
1083,TRAIN_0_1083,Jocelyn," Look, half the time I'm there he doesn't even want me there. I just can't help myself.",,,0
1084,TRAIN_0_1084,Roland," Well, you love him.",,,0
1085,TRAIN_0_1085,Jocelyn, Yeah.,,,0
1086,TRAIN_0_1086,Roland," I love him too, but the kid's an idiot.",,,0
1087,TRAIN_0_1087,Jocelyn," It's our son, Mutt. We're talking about our son. ",,,0
1088,TRAIN_0_1088,Roland, Yeah.,,,0
1089,TRAIN_0_1089,Johnny, Oh!,,,0
1090,TRAIN_0_1090,Roland, Our son.,,,0
1091,TRAIN_0_1091,Moira, Oh!,,,0
1092,TRAIN_0_1092,Roland, You done with that? Got it.,,,0
1093,TRAIN_0_1093,Johnny," No, I wasn't. I wasn't uh...",,,0
1094,TRAIN_0_1094,Roland," Yeah, he turned into a real nutbar. Doesn't drive in cars, he won't use anything plastic. Good luck with birth control, right? ",,,0
1095,TRAIN_0_1095,Jocelyn, And then we see you with your kids and you're so... together. What's your secret?,,,0
1096,TRAIN_0_1096,Moira, Listening is so very important.,,,0
1097,TRAIN_0_1097,Johnny, So important to listen... To your kids. ,,,0
1098,TRAIN_0_1098,Jocelyn," See, Roland? Listening.",,,0
1099,TRAIN_0_1099,Roland," Excuse me, I listen to the kid. If he'd listened to me, he wouldn't be sitting in a hut, making his own underwear.",,,0
1100,TRAIN_0_1100,David, The Internet is a breeding ground for freaks.,,,0
1101,TRAIN_0_1101,Stevie, What're you doing?,,,0
1102,TRAIN_0_1102,David," Well, I just ""sold"" a pair of sunglasses on here and now dieforfash87 is telling me she won't pay 'cause she thinks they're fake.",,,0
1103,TRAIN_0_1103,Stevie, Okay. Um... How about we move away-,,,0
1104,TRAIN_0_1104,David, No! I don't even wanna sell these things. These clothes are all that I have. Everything else has been taken from me.,,,0
1105,TRAIN_0_1105,Stevie," Well, you have your family...",,,0
1106,TRAIN_0_1106,David," What's your point? I am having a very hard time right now dealing with the idea that people think that my things are worthless, Or funky, or... ",,,0
1107,TRAIN_0_1107,Stevie, Sorry.,,,0
1108,TRAIN_0_1108,David,...fake. Does it look like I shop on Canal Street?,,,0
1109,TRAIN_0_1109,Stevie, No...,,,0
1110,TRAIN_0_1110,David, Okay.,,,0
1111,TRAIN_0_1111,Stevie," People here don't know anything, okay? Wayne huffs keyboard cleaner for a living.",,,0
1112,TRAIN_0_1112,David," Well, that's not surprising.",,,0
1113,TRAIN_0_1113,Stevie," You're playing to the wrong crowd. You're-you have great clothes. I like some of this stuff. Like... like this. Like, I like this. Ooh! Ooh... I like this. This gives me an idea.",,,0
1114,TRAIN_0_1114,Mutt, So why would I sleep with my mother?,,,0
1115,TRAIN_0_1115,Alexis," Well, now that I know that she's your mother, that makes a lot more sense to me.",,,0
1116,TRAIN_0_1116,Mutt, And you normally go around spying on people?,,,0
1117,TRAIN_0_1117,Alexis," Um, you left me here to be abducted by long haul truckers. I just went to find you. So why are you sneaking around with your mom anyway? What's the big... secret?",,,0
1118,TRAIN_0_1118,Mutt," It's my dad. We don't really get along. He really takes the whole mayor tradition in the family thing seriously and I'm just not that down into labels, you know?",,,0
1119,TRAIN_0_1119,Alexis," ""Labels?""",,,0
1120,TRAIN_0_1120,Mutt, Yeah.,,,0
1121,TRAIN_0_1121,Alexis, And you wonder why I make fun of you.,,,0
1122,TRAIN_0_1122,Mutt," Oh, and you are totally in sync with your parents?",,,0
1123,TRAIN_1_1123,Alexis," Um... yeah, because they always wanted a daughter with a record, who dropped out of college, so... Pretty much delivered on that one. ",SARCASTIC, Alexis dropping out of college and having a criminal record is a disappointment for her parents,1
1124,TRAIN_0_1124,Alexis, Ugh! Oh!,,,0
1125,TRAIN_0_1125,Stevie," Okay, this is gonna cheer you up.",,,0
1126,TRAIN_0_1126,Stevie," So I thought you might be lonely without your clothes. So if this isn't too dirty for you, I could help take care of your stuff.",,,0
1127,TRAIN_0_1127,David," Wait, you wanna have s*x with me?",,,0
1128,TRAIN_0_1128,Stevie, No. I don't think anybody has s*x in here unless they're being paid for it. I thought this might be a good place to store your clothes.,,,0
1129,TRAIN_0_1129,David, Is this a safe place?,,,0
1130,TRAIN_0_1130,Stevie," Yes. I'm the only with a key. But there's a catch. I get to wear whatever I want, anytime I want.",,,0
1131,TRAIN_0_1131,David, Fine.,,,0
1132,TRAIN_0_1132,Johnny, Wow! Our son's clothes are no longer in our closet. Something I said finally got through.,,,0
1133,TRAIN_0_1133,David, I just found somewhere else to put them.,,,0
1134,TRAIN_0_1134,Johnny, I can't hear you from in there.,,,0
1135,TRAIN_0_1135,David, I found somewhere else to put them!,,,0
1136,TRAIN_0_1136,Johnny," Well, subconsciously I got through. David? Alexis? Can you come here please?",,,0
1137,TRAIN_0_1137,Woman on TV," Oh, I don't know. Maybe the text I got from her saying you left your ring in the sauna... ",,,0
1138,TRAIN_0_1138,Johnny, David?! Alexis?!,,,0
1139,TRAIN_0_1139,Moira," They're not going to come, dear.",,,0
1140,TRAIN_0_1140,Johnny," Well, how widespread is that news?",,,0
1141,TRAIN_0_1141,Woman on TV, I can hear the Deal sign.,,,0
1142,TRAIN_0_1142,Johnny, Talk about salacious!,,,0
1143,TRAIN_0_1143,Man on TV, He had long day at work. I ran into Tanya on the street. ,,,0
1144,TRAIN_0_1144,Moira, He cut off his what?!,,,0
1145,TRAIN_0_1145,Alexis," Wait, what? – ",,,0
1146,TRAIN_0_1146,Johnny, Okay.,,,0
1147,TRAIN_0_1147,David, How did it happen?,,,0
1148,TRAIN_0_1148,Johnny," Look, I just, uh... I just want to make sure that, uh, you know, we're all okay. ",,,0
1149,TRAIN_0_1149,Alexis, What were we not okay about?,,,0
1150,TRAIN_0_1150,Johnny, About your mother and me feeling disconnected from you two.,,,0
1151,TRAIN_1_1151,David, We are literally connected by a door that does not lock. How much... how much more connected do you wanna be? ,RHETORICAL, David does not want the answer to this question. He is pointing out that they could not be physically any closer,1

1179,TRAIN_0_1179,Alexis, Ew! Ew! Ew!,,,0
1180,TRAIN_0_1180,Moira," I hate to be the one to tell you, but having sex is not just about making children so they can grow up and make you feel bad about having sex. ",,,0
1181,TRAIN_0_1181,Alexis," Oh my God, can you stop this please?!",,,0
1182,TRAIN_0_1182,Moira, I will not be shamed. Shame on you.,,,0

1196,TRAIN_0_1196,Roland," Okay, all right. I get what this is about. You and the wife wanna bump the old uglies, huh?",,,0
1197,TRAIN_0_1197,Johnny, I have no idea what that means.,,,0
1198,TRAIN_0_1198,Roland," Having a little problem down there below there, Johnny boy, huh?",,,0

1200,TRAIN_0_1200,Roland," It's okay, I get it. I get it, captain. You've been out to sea for a while you wanna bring the boat into port and maybe... get your mast scrubbed. What're you guys down to now? Like... twice a day?",,,0

1202,TRAIN_0_1202,Roland," Well, how 'bout I do you one better? We got a cabin up by the lake. It's just a little love nest for the lady and me. You know, when we wanna spark the old spark from time to time. My gift to you and yours for the night.",,,0
1203,TRAIN_0_1203,Johnny," So generous, but I'm gonna take a pass.",,,0
1204,TRAIN_0_1204,Jocelyn," Hey, Johnny.",,,0
1205,TRAIN_0_1205,Johnny, Jocelyn?,,,0
1206,TRAIN_0_1206,Jocelyn, How are you? ,,,0
1207,TRAIN_0_1207,Johnny," Uh, good. Good.",,,0
1208,TRAIN_0_1208,Roland, Sex life's in the crapper. I just offered him the cabin. That is so not true.,,,0
1209,TRAIN_0_1209,Jocelyn, I knew something was wrong.,,,0
1210,TRAIN_0_1210,Johnny, N-nothing is wrong.,,,0
1211,TRAIN_0_1211,Jocelyn, You should take the cabin. I wouldn't wanna see your relationship get any worse.,,,0

1218,TRAIN_0_1218,Moira," I, for one, think we should take them up on their offer.",,,0
1219,TRAIN_0_1219,Johnny, I can't believe what I'm hearing here. We're talking about Roland's place. Who knows what the hell we're gonna find up there?,,,0
1220,TRAIN_0_1220,Moira," Well, we can't share any real intimacy here in this internment camp, John, and I don't want to turn into my parents. Separate beds, separate rooms. ",,,0
1221,TRAIN_0_1221,Johnny," Well, separate countries.",,,0
1222,TRAIN_0_1222,Moira, Exactly! A bad marriage!,,,0

1227,TRAIN_0_1227,Johnny," You know, I'm starting to get a pretty good feeling myself.  Are you?",,,0
1228,TRAIN_1_1228,David, Oh my God! Am I being punished for something? ,RHETORICAL, David is upset that he keeps walking in on his parents getting intimate,1
1229,TRAIN_0_1229,Moira," David, are you dirty peeping tom?",,,0
1230,TRAIN_0_1230,David," I don't think parenting books would approve of you saying that to me. I'm here to grab a magazine, and go back and leave you guys to whatever disgusting... ",,,0
1231,TRAIN_0_1231,Moira, Stay.,,,0
1232,TRAIN_0_1232,Johnny," Stick around, stick around.",,,0

1234,TRAIN_0_1234,Johnny, Alexis!,,,0
1235,TRAIN_0_1235,David, They're done!,,,0
1236,TRAIN_0_1236,Moira, Your father and I have some very important news.,,,0
1237,TRAIN_0_1237,Alexis," If you tell me that you're pregnant, I'm gonna vomit on this floor right now.",,,0
1238,TRAIN_0_1238,Moira," Oh, can you imagine?",,,0
1239,TRAIN_0_1239,Johnny, We're planning a trip.,,,0
1240,TRAIN_0_1240,David, Okay.,,,0
1241,TRAIN_0_1241,Johnny," Just to a cabin, overnight... And we request that the two of you not try to contact us for the next 24 hours.",,,0
1242,TRAIN_0_1242,David, I really appreciate you doing that for me.,,,0
1243,TRAIN_0_1243,Johnny, I'm doing it for us.,,,0
1244,TRAIN_0_1244,David," Well, it's to my benefit.",,,0
1245,TRAIN_0_1245,Alexis," Um, why don't you guys stay at the cabin for longer?",,,0
1246,TRAIN_0_1246,Moira," Oh, I would never just abandon you two in a motel in the middle of nowhere. ",,,0
1247,TRAIN_0_1247,David, Didn't you once take the wrong baby home from preschool? ,,,0
1248,TRAIN_0_1248,Moira, Alexis looked Chinese as an infant. How many times must I defend myself?,,,0
1249,TRAIN_0_1249,Johnny, So we're good then? Thank you. ,,,0
1250,TRAIN_0_1250,David," No, thank you. ",,,0

1253,TRAIN_0_1253,Johnny," Enough, David! ",,,0
1254,TRAIN_0_1254,Moira, Thank you so much for the loan of your cabin and your truck. ,,,0
1255,TRAIN_0_1255,Roland," Looks like you folks got a lot of gear here, huh? Is that the tickle trunk? ",,,0
1256,TRAIN_0_1256,Johnny, It's just clothes. ,,,0
1257,TRAIN_0_1257,Roland," Yeah, okay, but just keep in mind there's only 60 amp service there, so don't be pluggin' a lot of gadgets in all at once, if you know what I mean. ",,,0
1258,TRAIN_0_1258,Moira, Yet another disturbing look into his world.,,,0
1259,TRAIN_0_1259,Roland," All right, directions. Super easy, Johnny. Here's what I want you to do.  Okay, I want you take highway 10 to Loon Lake Road north, okay? I want you to take a right there. There's gonna be a split in the fence, I want you to go left at that split, and keep going. Go through the intersection of Loon Lake Road south, okay? And then you're gonna find Pine Road. Now you go up Pine Road, I want you take a right at that big oak tree, all right? It's old, it's big, you can't miss it. You go down the hill to the left and we're the third cabin on the right, okay? The key's under the mat.",,,0
1260,TRAIN_0_1260,Johnny, Got it.,,,0
1261,TRAIN_0_1261,Moira, Really?,,,0
1262,TRAIN_0_1262,Johnny, Key is under the mat.,,,0
1263,TRAIN_0_1263,David, So I think I'm gonna go next door because your mess is making me anxious.,,,0
1264,TRAIN_0_1264,Alexis, What mess?,,,0
1265,TRAIN_0_1265,David, You know how clean my apartment was in New York. It was so clean. It was really clean.,,,0
1266,TRAIN_0_1266,Alexis," Well, it was very clean because you had a maid to keep it very clean for you.",,,0
1267,TRAIN_0_1267,David," No. I kept it clean after Cecilia cleaned. Anyway, I think it's best if we just take some space and um... I am looking forward to sleeping in a bed that his not... made for a toddler.",,,0
1268,TRAIN_0_1268,Alexis, Okay. I'll just chill here in my own space and...,,,0
1269,TRAIN_0_1269,David, Yeah.,,,0
1270,TRAIN_0_1270,Alexis, Maybe I'll do a mask or something and... check in with myself and see how I'm doing... ,,,0
1271,TRAIN_0_1271,David," Okay, so we're good? ",,,0
1272,TRAIN_0_1272,Alexis, Yeah.,,,0
1273,TRAIN_0_1273,David, Okay. See you tomorrow.,,,0

1275,TRAIN_0_1275,David, I'm sorry to hear that.,,,0
1276,TRAIN_0_1276,Alexis," Okay, so I think that we should take advantage of mom and dad being gone.",,,0
1277,TRAIN_0_1277,David, I am.,,,0
1278,TRAIN_0_1278,Alexis," Okay, but like throwing a party or something.",,,0
1279,TRAIN_0_1279,David, No. Absolutely not.,,,0
1280,TRAIN_0_1280,Alexis," Just a tiny, little, casual motel party.",,,0
1281,TRAIN_0_1281,David," Okay, Alexis, I have no interest in finding out what types of people are attracted to ""casual motel parties."" ",,,0
1282,TRAIN_0_1282,Alexis, But you do have an interest in lounging on a bed that mom and dad have had sex all over?,,,0
1283,TRAIN_0_1283,David, Why would you do that to me right now?,,,0
1284,TRAIN_0_1284,Alexis," David, I just... I miss my life! And I miss doing things. And I miss being surrounded by loose acquaintances who think that I'm... funny, and smart, and charming. ",,,0
1285,TRAIN_0_1285,David, Will you?  Just a few people. Please. You can't tell me that you don't wanna hang out with people other than me. David, Obviously.,,0
1286,TRAIN_0_1286,Alexis," Okay, so...?",,,0
1287,TRAIN_0_1287,David," Okay, fine. Something small. ",,,0
1288,TRAIN_0_1288,Alexis, Yes!,,,0
1289,TRAIN_0_1289,David, Like a little games night.,,,0
1290,TRAIN_0_1290,Alexis," Yes, like a small, little games night party.",,,0
1291,TRAIN_0_1291,David, No. Like a little games night period.,,,0
1292,TRAIN_0_1292,Alexis," Okay, fine. And then, if it turns into something else, it turns into something else. ",,,0
1293,TRAIN_0_1293,David," Well, it won't 'cause there's only six people invited. Any more and game play gets too yelly. ",,,0
1294,TRAIN_0_1294,Alexis," It gets very yelly. Okay, this party is gonna be...",,,0
1295,TRAIN_0_1295,David, It's not a party.,,,0
1296,TRAIN_0_1296,Alexis, awesome!,,,0
1297,TRAIN_0_1297,David, It's not a party.,,,0
1298,TRAIN_0_1298,Alexis, So. Much. Fun! I'm so excited!,,,0

1300,TRAIN_0_1300,Moira, I am shocked and delighted.,,,0
1301,TRAIN_0_1301,Johnny," Yes. I have to say I was nervous about this, but I've gotta hand it to Roland, he came through.",,,0
1302,TRAIN_1_1302,Johnny," He's moron! Key's under the mat, is it? ",RHETORICAL," Johnny is making fun of Roland for saying the key was under the mat, when it was not",1
1303,TRAIN_0_1303,Johnny," The key is under the mat! Agh! That's great! Lying son-of-a... Agh! Idiot man! Moron! Ha! Oh, good.",,,0
1304,TRAIN_0_1304,Moira, John?!,,,0
1305,TRAIN_0_1305,Johnny," Yeah! Coming, honey! I'm coming. Well hellooooo.",,,0
1306,TRAIN_0_1306,Moira," Oh, my car broke down and it's raining, and I wondered if I might spend the night. ",,,0
1307,TRAIN_0_1307,Johnny," Well, first let's get you out of those... dry clothes and we'll see where the night takes us. ",,,0
1308,TRAIN_0_1308,David," So I need to flesh out this games night thing. Between you and my sister, and the barn guy and that girl in the restaurant, we have 5, and obviously we need an even 6 for ultimate game play. ",,,0
1309,TRAIN_0_1309,Stevie," Well, what if I'm not a games person?",,,0
1310,TRAIN_0_1310,David," We're far too similar for you not to be, so... Options, please. Obviously they need to be funny, and smart, and have well-rounded sense of humour and a wide range of knowledge.",,,0
1311,TRAIN_0_1311,Stevie," Oh, all those types of people move away from here.",,,0
1312,TRAIN_0_1312,David, That's funny.,,,0
1313,TRAIN_0_1313,Stevie," No, I'm serious.",,,0
1314,TRAIN_0_1314,Stevie," Ooh, what about Eric?",,,0
1315,TRAIN_0_1315,David, Hmm?,,,0
1316,TRAIN_0_1316,Stevie, He finished high school.,,,0
1317,TRAIN_0_1317,David, I don't love his look.,,,0
1318,TRAIN_1_1318,Stevie," Oh, looks are important? Oh... Why don't we throw a pageant? ",RHETORICAL, Stevie is making fun of David for being so particular,1
1319,TRAIN_0_1319,David," Trust me, if I had time, we would, but we don't, so...",,,0
1320,TRAIN_1_1320,Stevie, What about Sarah? She's cute and speaks english. ,SARCASTIC, Speaking English is a basic requirement to play. Stevie is making fun of David for being so particular,1
1321,TRAIN_0_1321,David, Hmm? Mm... She get it?,,,0
1322,TRAIN_0_1322,Stevie, Get what?,,,0
1323,TRAIN_0_1323,David," Like ""get it"" get it. It, like the vibe. Understand that games night needs to run a certain way, otherwise it won't work.",,,0
1324,TRAIN_1_1324,Stevie, Can I be on your team? You sound really fun. ,SARCASTIC, David does not sound like fun to play with,1
1325,TRAIN_0_1325,David," Listen, you don't have to help me out if you don't want to.",,,0
1326,TRAIN_0_1326,David, I can find someone else.,,,0
1327,TRAIN_0_1327,Stevie, Really?,,,0
1328,TRAIN_0_1328,David, Mm-hmm.,,,0
1329,TRAIN_0_1329,Stevie, Okay.,,,0
1330,TRAIN_0_1330,David," Well, it's-okay.",,,0
1331,TRAIN_0_1331,Stevie, Have fun. ,,,0
1332,TRAIN_0_1332,David, Okay. ,,,0
1333,TRAIN_0_1333,Stevie, My money's on the other team. ,,,0
1334,TRAIN_0_1334,David, Hi.  ,,,0
1335,TRAIN_0_1335,Stevie, Can I help you? ,,,0
1336,TRAIN_0_1336,David," Yeah, I just uh... Came to apologize. ",,,0
1337,TRAIN_0_1337,Stevie, For what? ,,,0
1338,TRAIN_0_1338,David, For uninviting you to games night. ,,,0
1339,TRAIN_0_1339,Stevie, You did not uninvite me. I uninvited myself. ,,,0
1340,TRAIN_0_1340,David," Mm-hmm. Okay, well, um... I would really like it if you came and I would really love it if you could bring... one other person of your choosing. ",,,0
1341,TRAIN_0_1341,Stevie, So it doesn't matter if they don't blend? ,,,0
1342,TRAIN_0_1342,David, M-mm-mm. ,,,0
1343,TRAIN_0_1343,Stevie, And this doesn't have anything to do with the fact that you couldn't find anybody else to come?,,,0
1344,TRAIN_0_1344,David," No. What? No. I... You are a very bright, funny person, with a wide range of useful knowledge and the fact that we don't have an ideal number for team style game-play, is not... not why I'm here. ",,,0
1345,TRAIN_0_1345,Stevie," You're such a liar. And I was bluffing when I said I wasn't coming. I just wanted to see you beg, so...",,,0
1346,TRAIN_0_1346,David, Okay.,,,0
1347,TRAIN_0_1347,Stevie," I'll put out some feelers, but, you know, such short notice, all the town hotties will have plans. ",,,0
1348,TRAIN_0_1348,David, I'll see you tonight! ,,,0
1349,TRAIN_0_1349,Stevie," Yeah, thanks.",,,0

1351,TRAIN_0_1351,Stevie, Welcome.,,,0
1352,TRAIN_0_1352,Moira, This place is almost charming. Very rustic cottage. I was half expecting early unibomber.,,,0
1353,TRAIN_0_1353,Johnny," Oh, look! Roland and Jocelyn.",,,0
1354,TRAIN_0_1354,Moira, Who are the other two?,,,0
1355,TRAIN_0_1355,Johnny," Well, that's Bob. He's on the town council.",,,0
1356,TRAIN_0_1356,Moira," And his partner? Roland has gay friends! Again, shocked and delighted. ",,,0
1357,TRAIN_0_1357,Johnny, I think that's his wife.,,,0
1358,TRAIN_0_1358,Moira," No, they're both called husband. Look at the them smiling away.  What have they got to be so happy about?",,,0
1359,TRAIN_0_1359,Johnny," Well, they have no money issues. That's why they're so happy.",,,0
1360,TRAIN_0_1360,Moira," Yeah, they just don't know any better.",,,0
1361,TRAIN_0_1361,David," So, Eric, how do you know Stevie?",,,0

1366,TRAIN_0_1366,Alexis," You guys came. Together. That's so cute! Come in! Twyla, you look amazing! Mutt, you look like a mill dollars.",,,0
1367,TRAIN_0_1367,Twyla," Okay, so I brought this pie from work but on the way, I realized I didn't check what kind so there's a 50/50 chance there's meat in it. ",,,0
1368,TRAIN_0_1368,Alexis," Oh my God, that's so cute. Thank you.",,,0
1369,TRAIN_0_1369,David," Okay, so it's 8",15. It's 8,"15. We should have started at 8. So... fifteen minutes late, let's sit down and I will... explain the game.",0
1370,TRAIN_0_1370,Alexis," And I would just like to thank everybody so much for coming.  This is the first social thing that I've done in like a really long time, so let's just have so much fun and we'll just see where the night takes us. ",,,0
1371,TRAIN_0_1371,David," Well, it'll take us to a three part games night that ends at 10.",,,0

1376,TRAIN_0_1376,Mutt, I don't think I can fit ten names on this piece of paper.,,,0
1377,TRAIN_0_1377,David," That's funny. That's funny. No. One per piece of paper. Ten pieces of paper, ten names.",,,0
1378,TRAIN_0_1378,Eric, Who should I put down?,,,0
1379,TRAIN_0_1379,David," I can't tell you that, Eric, 'cause that would wreck the game.",,,0

1414,TRAIN_0_1414,Johnny, How long have you been here?,,,0
1415,TRAIN_0_1415,Bob," Quite a while. Yeah, you seemed to have a little trouble there, getting going. And, uh, well, we uh... We didn't think you needed the extra pressure on you, so... ",,,0
1416,TRAIN_0_1416,Gwen," Oh, hi! You're good.",,,0
1417,TRAIN_0_1417,Moira, And you are?,,,0

1435,TRAIN_0_1435,Alexis, Stop yelling at her though!,,,0
1436,TRAIN_0_1436,David, It's the point of the game is the yell!,,,0
1437,TRAIN_0_1437,Mutt, She's a mother and has your cousin's name.,,,0

1447,TRAIN_0_1447,David, No! Absolutely not!,,,0
1448,TRAIN_0_1448,Alexis," Every time the vein in my brother's eye twitches, we take a drink. ",,,0
1449,TRAIN_0_1449,David, Why would you bring up my eye in front of all these people? ,,,0
1450,TRAIN_0_1450,David, Who is that?!,,,0
1451,TRAIN_0_1451,Alexis," Calm down. Dane thought he should just invite over a few more of his friends, so... ",,,0
1452,TRAIN_0_1452,David," Oh, did he?",,,0
1453,TRAIN_0_1453,Alexis, Yeah.,,,0
1454,TRAIN_0_1454,Dane, Who's up for strip poker? ,,,0
1455,TRAIN_0_1455,David," Okay, you know what? I'm out. No, that's it. I'm gonna call it a night. I'm gonna pack it in. Eric, don't look at my eye!",,,0
1456,TRAIN_0_1456,Alexis," Why are you being such an old woman?  I'm sorry that I wanted to have fun tonight and invite a few random guys over and try and make out with them, okay? You're not the only one dying in this town. It is boring and I am just trying to make the best of it. I'm really sorry everybody. No offense, okay? ",,,0
1457,TRAIN_0_1457,Twyla, I'm well-versed in family conflict...,,,0
1458,TRAIN_0_1458,David," I'm sure you are. Alexis? If you want to party, have a party. But I have a queen bed next door with my name on it and I have been looking forward to sleeping in that bed all day, so... ",,,0
1459,TRAIN_0_1459,Mutt, Maybe we should go. ,,,0
1460,TRAIN_0_1460,Alexis," No. You know what, guys? It's totally fine. David, I would love it if you would come and party with us, but it's totally up to you. ",,,0
1461,TRAIN_0_1461,David," And I'm totally gonna go. So everybody have a good night. I don't know who you are! Dane, put that down and get off my bed! No one on my bed tonight. And don't-no one throw up!",,,0
1462,TRAIN_0_1462,Alexis," So his eye twitched five times, so drink up, bitches!",,,0
1463,TRAIN_0_1463,Guys, All right!,,,0
1464,TRAIN_0_1464,Alexis, Woo!,,,0
1465,TRAIN_0_1465,Dane, Shots! All right. Ready and... ,,,0
1466,TRAIN_0_1466,Johnny," And once again, my apologies.",,,0
1467,TRAIN_0_1467,Moira," And I'm sorry, I don't know how to make a bed.",,,0
1468,TRAIN_0_1468,Johnny," And I may have damaged your corkscrew, Bob.",,,0
1469,TRAIN_0_1469,Bob, You broke it in half.,,,0
1470,TRAIN_0_1470,Johnny," Okay, the door, it won't open. The door won't open.",,,0
1471,TRAIN_0_1471,Bob, It's locked.,,,0
1472,TRAIN_0_1472,Johnny," Oh, it's locked.",,,0
1473,TRAIN_0_1473,Moira, What do you want from us?,,,0
1474,TRAIN_0_1474,Bob," Yes, it's... it's locked to prevent strangers from coming into the cabin. See, uh, we didn't realize that, uh, strangers would already be in the cabin when we locked it.",,,0
1475,TRAIN_0_1475,Johnny, I see. Oh. Okay.,,,0
1476,TRAIN_0_1476,Moira, Bye!,,,0
1477,TRAIN_0_1477,Johnny, There we go.,,,0
1478,TRAIN_0_1478,Moira, Thank you. Bye.,,,0
1479,TRAIN_0_1479,Johnny," You've been consummate hosts, really. Fantastic day.",,,0
1480,TRAIN_0_1480,Twyla," Hey, Mutt, can you pass me a drink? Um...",,,0
1481,TRAIN_0_1481,Stevie, Sorry. Hey!,,,0
1482,TRAIN_0_1482,David, Hi!,,,0
1483,TRAIN_0_1483,Stevie," Here's the thing. Um, I'm sorry that you and your sister are in a domestic, and I'm sorry that I invited Eric. That joke was funnier in theory.",,,0
1484,TRAIN_0_1484,David, Bad joke.,,,0
1485,TRAIN_0_1485,Stevie, But I'm gonna need you to come back in there.,,,0
1486,TRAIN_0_1486,David, Why?,,,0
1487,TRAIN_0_1487,Stevie," Because I don't really like most of those people and, believe it or not, we are in the middle of a very intense game of drunken charades and my team is losing. Badly. ",,,0
1488,TRAIN_0_1488,David," Well, that's not really my thing.",,,0
1489,TRAIN_0_1489,Stevie," It's not my thing either, but you were right; We're way too similar and I am having a very hard time losing, so... I will happily let you get back to this big queen bed if you'll just help us win a few more rounds. Just need somebody sober.",,,0
1490,TRAIN_0_1490,David, I can't...,,,0
1491,TRAIN_0_1491,Stevie, Please.,,,0
1492,TRAIN_0_1492,David, Go back in there. It's embarrassing. ,,,0
1493,TRAIN_0_1493,Stevie, They are way too drunk to remember.  Just two winning rounds and then it's over. Then you can go back to your book. ,,,0
1494,TRAIN_0_1494,David, Fine. Fine. Two rounds.,,,0
1495,TRAIN_0_1495,Stevie, You can go back to sleep. ,,,0
1496,TRAIN_0_1496,David, Quick. Quick rounds. ,,,0
1497,TRAIN_0_1497,Stevie, Thank you.,,,0
1498,TRAIN_0_1498,David, Fine.,,,0
1499,TRAIN_0_1499,Stevie, Thank you. ,,,0
1500,TRAIN_0_1500,Stevie," And just don't look at the stain on your bed, and we'll mime something special. ",,,0
1501,TRAIN_0_1501,David, What stain?,,,0
1502,TRAIN_0_1502,Stevie, Uh...,,,0
1503,TRAIN_0_1503,David, You're lucky I'm good at this game. ,,,0
1504,TRAIN_0_1504,Dane, Yes! A mexican...,,,0
1505,TRAIN_0_1505,Alexis, Just get this one!,,,0
1506,TRAIN_0_1506,Moira," Are you sure you don't want to call a tradesman or someone, John? ",,,0
1507,TRAIN_0_1507,Johnny," Moira, I don't need a tradesman. I can handle a screwdriver, okay? This is working out just... fine. And... that... is... in. Look at this. Instant lock.",,,0
1508,TRAIN_0_1508,Moira," Yes, let me tell you, Eddie. You look awfully good in that blue collar.",,,0
1509,TRAIN_0_1509,Johnny,"  Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Rose. I don't often get compliments when I'm fixing doors. ",,,0
1510,TRAIN_0_1510,Moira," Oh, Edward, I'm afraid I must tell you, I shan't be able to pay you today. ",,,0
1511,TRAIN_0_1511,Johnny,"  Well, that's okay, Mrs. Rose. Maybe there's um... some other way you can pay me, if you get my drift. ",,,0
1512,TRAIN_0_1512,Alexis, Did you take my mask?  Thank you.,,,0
1513,TRAIN_0_1513,Johnny," Well, maybe I'll use a bigger screw, Mrs. Rose. Don't you go anywheres. ",,,0
1514,TRAIN_0_1514,Moira," I'll be right here, Eddie. ",,,0
1515,TRAIN_0_1515,Johnny," Hey, Moira, could you turn that down please? Important call coming through.",,,0
1516,TRAIN_0_1516,Stevie says it's the guy from the winery.,,,,0
1517,TRAIN_0_1517,Moira, Hmm.,,,0
1518,TRAIN_0_1518,Johnny," Hello, Johnny Rose. Hello? Hello? Ah. Stevie?",,,0
1519,TRAIN_0_1519,Stevie, I put it through!,,,0

1527,TRAIN_0_1527,Stevie, Okay! ,,,0
1528,TRAIN_0_1528,Johnny," Very good suggestion! Kids! David, answer the phone!",,,0
1529,TRAIN_0_1529,Alexis, He has his headphones in; He can't hear it.,,,0
1530,TRAIN_0_1530,Johnny, Then you answer it!,,,0
1531,TRAIN_0_1531,Alexis, Okay! Hello?,,,0
1532,TRAIN_0_1532,Johnny,"Alexis, could you open the door, please? I'll take it.",,,0
1533,TRAIN_0_1533,Alexis," No, sorry, you have the wrong room. He's actually in room 6.",,,0
1534,TRAIN_0_1534,Johnny," Alexis, unlock the door please!",,,0
1535,TRAIN_0_1535,Alexis, Okay! No problem. Bye. He's gonna call you back in your room!,,,0
1536,TRAIN_0_1536,Johnny, No!,,,0
1537,TRAIN_0_1537,Moira, Hello?,,,0
1538,TRAIN_0_1538,David, Can you get a heart murmur from a lack of sleep? Because I have not slept since we’ve got here and I think my body is shutting down. ,,,0
1539,TRAIN_1_1539,Alexis," Well, I hate to admit it, but I actually know very little about heart murmurs. ",SARCASTIC, Alexis obviously does not know anything about heart murmurs. She is making fun of David for asking her about it,1
1540,TRAIN_0_1540,David," Well, I have one. Uh, the pulse is very irregular.",,,0
1541,TRAIN_0_1541,Alexis," Honestly, David, I have tried to find my pulse like a thousand times and nothing. So don't worry about it. ",,,0
1542,TRAIN_0_1542,David," No, this is very serious!  My heart has not rested in a long time, my immune system is very low, I have not been able to find kale anywhere here- ",,,0
1543,TRAIN_1_1543,Alexis, how long are we going to be talking about you for? ,RHETORICAL, Alexis wants David to stop talking about himself,1
1544,TRAIN_0_1544,David," I think I'm having a heart attack, is what's happening! ",,,0
1545,TRAIN_0_1545,Alexis," David, you are like 34.",,,0
1546,TRAIN_0_1546,David, I'm basically 29.,,,0
1547,TRAIN_0_1547,Alexis," Oh my God, you are overreacting. ",,,0
1548,TRAIN_0_1548,David, I think you're gonna feel very guilty when I slip into a coma and you have to come visit me in the hospital at hospice. ,,,0
1549,TRAIN_1_1549,Alexis," Well, I'm gonna go for a jog, so don't die until I get back. ",SARCASTIC, Alexis is making fun of David for being dramatic,1
1550,TRAIN_0_1550,David," Well, how long are you going for?",,,0
1551,TRAIN_1_1551,Alexis," Um, I don't really know. How long are you gonna be like this for? ",RHETORICAL, Alexis wants David to stop being dramatic,1
1552,TRAIN_0_1552,David, Don't be a little b... ,,,0
1553,TRAIN_0_1553,Alexis, Bye!,,,0
1554,TRAIN_0_1554,David, When I'm this state!   ,,,0
1555,TRAIN_0_1555,Herb Ertlinger," Now, it's fruit wine, which is exciting in itself. But the thing we're most proud of is that our fruit is 100% insecticide free. ",,,0
1556,TRAIN_0_1556,Johnny, Ah!,,,0
1557,TRAIN_0_1557,Moira, Mm! Mm! Mm.  There's something in mine.,,,0
1558,TRAIN_0_1558,Herb Ertlinger," Oh, that's a ladybug. That's one of the good ones. Excuse me. Herb Ertlinger...",,,0
1559,TRAIN_0_1559,Moira," No, this tastes like something one should not put in their mouth.",,,0
1560,TRAIN_1_1560,Johnny, It's fruit wine. Whoever heard of fruit wine? ,RHETORICAL," Johnny thinks fruit wine is stupid Doesn't matter, it's a business. I'll make it work.",1
1561,TRAIN_0_1561,Moira," It's next to a landfill, John.",,,0
1562,TRAIN_0_1562,Johnny, He said former landfill.,,,0
1563,TRAIN_0_1563,Herb Ertlinger, Sorry. I was looking into a new sprayer. And I brought you this... It's our Cabernet Merlot petit grenache.,,,0
1564,TRAIN_0_1564,Moira and Johnny, Oh!,,,0
1565,TRAIN_1_1565,Moira, Sounds delightfully busy. ,SARCASTIC, Moira does not like how many different kinds of grapes are in the wine. She is being sarcastic with the word “delightful.”,1
1566,TRAIN_0_1566,Johnny," You know, uh, Herb, if you need any help with distribution, I have extensive contacts in that area, or if it's operations management... ",,,0
1567,TRAIN_0_1567,Herb Ertlinger," Johnny, while I appreciate that offer, it's actually not your help I'm looking for.",,,0
1568,TRAIN_0_1568,Johnny, Oh.,,,0
1569,TRAIN_0_1569,Herb Ertlinger," No. It's you, Moira. We were hoping that you will be the spokesperson for Herb Ertlinger fruit wines.",,,0
1570,TRAIN_0_1570,Moira, I-I don't understand.,,,0
1571,TRAIN_0_1571,Herb Ertlinger," My wife and I were such big fans of ""Sunrise Bay."" And we would be an honoured to have you do just a few commercials to promote our wine. That is, of course, if you like it. ",,,0
1572,TRAIN_0_1572,Moira, Like it? It's fruit wine. What's not to like?,,,0
1573,TRAIN_0_1573,David," So, an hour ago, I thought I was having a heart attack.",,,0
1574,TRAIN_0_1574,Stevie, Oh no!,,,0
1575,TRAIN_0_1575,David," Yup, yup. Yup. Um, but I'm not.",,,0
1576,TRAIN_0_1576,Stevie," Oh, phew!",,,0
1577,TRAIN_0_1577,David," According to Web MD, I'm having a pulmonary embolism, which is much, much worse.",,,0
1578,TRAIN_0_1578,Stevie," Well, you look good.",,,0
1579,TRAIN_0_1579,David, That's... just the way I look. I need you to take me to a hospital right now.,,,0
1580,TRAIN_0_1580,Stevie," Yeah, the only hospital's in Elmdale.",,,0
1581,TRAIN_1_1581,David, You're telling me there's no doctor around here? People just drop dead in the streets out of sheer neglect? ,RHETORICAL, David is making fun of the town for not having a doctor,1
1582,TRAIN_0_1582,Stevie," Well, there is, technically, a doctor.",,,0
1583,TRAIN_0_1583,David," Then, please take me to that doctor right now.",,,0
1584,TRAIN_0_1584,David, I'm just not sleeping. I think there's a lack of oxygen getting to my heart because I'm feeling very suffocated.,,,0
1585,TRAIN_0_1585,Ted," Okay, right. Well, if it is a heart attack we're way too far away from the nearest hospital for you to make it through the night. ",,,0
1586,TRAIN_0_1586,David, What?,,,0
1587,TRAIN_0_1587,Ted," Kidding. Take a deep breath for me. Good. Now, have you been around any feces in the past two days?",,,0
1588,TRAIN_0_1588,David, I don't n...,,,0
1589,TRAIN_0_1589,Ted," So, no.",,,0
1590,TRAIN_0_1590,David, No.,,,0
1591,TRAIN_0_1591,Ted," Okay. Well, the good thing is, I don't think that you need an ambulance, David, because what I think is happening here is you're having a panic attack. ",,,0
1592,TRAIN_0_1592,David," Oh no, those... Those aren't real. Those are a PR spin for celebrity publicists. Trust me, I've known enough celebrities.",,,0
1593,TRAIN_0_1593,Ted," No, it's absolutely a... A real thing. Uh, tell me, have you had any experiences lately that have caused you... Stress or anxiety?",,,0
1594,TRAIN_0_1594,David," Uh, well, I went from living in a 25 hundred square foot Soho live/workspace to a motel room with my sister.",,,0
1595,TRAIN_0_1595,Ted, Wow. Eek. That'll do it. ,,,0
1596,TRAIN_0_1596,Moira," ""Hello, I'm Moira Rose for Herb-"" ""Oh, hi! I'm Moira Rose for Herb Ertlinger wines inviting you to try our latest offering, a fruity cab franc we call...

1597,TRAIN_0_1597,Johnny," ""Plummy bouquet""? Is this guy for real?",,,0
1598,TRAIN_0_1598,Moira," His turns of phrase leave much to be desired, but the wine is potable.",,,0
1599,TRAIN_0_1599,Johnny, You called it liquid stink this morning.,,,0
1600,TRAIN_0_1600,Moira, The whites seem less stinky.,,,0
1601,TRAIN_1_1601,Johnny, How about this tote bag? Two-ply toilet paper has more heft. ,SARCASTIC, Johnny thinks the tote bag is cheesy,1
1602,TRAIN_0_1602,Moira," I'm sensing negativity, John. Is this because he did not take you up on your offer?",,,0
1603,TRAIN_0_1603,Johnny," Are you kidding me? Come on! Hey, I haven't even given that guy a second's thought since I got home. I was doing him a favour, that's all. I don't want him tarnishing your reputation. I mean, have you read the literature? Look at this. ""The maximum benefit of the peachafication process."" ""Peachafication!"" Who uses a word like ""peachafication""? A moron... would use that. ",,,0
1604,TRAIN_0_1604,Moira, That moron is the first moron to offer me an acting role in a very long time. ,,,0
1605,TRAIN_0_1605,Johnny," Well, he's lucky to have you.",,,0
1606,TRAIN_0_1606,Moira," John, this commercial, in the right hands, could be... I don't want to use the word ""comeback,"" that's... I don't wanna jinx it, but...  John, no one knows the business better than you do.",,,0
1607,TRAIN_0_1607,Johnny," Oh, honey, I'm just the money behind the scenes. Not that I don't have a few company commercials under my belt, but... If you want me in your corner, I'm there.",,,0
1608,TRAIN_0_1608,Moira," Oh, John.  Thank you.",,,0
1609,TRAIN_0_1609,Johnny, I'll do what I can.,,,0
1610,TRAIN_0_1610,Moira, Thank you.,,,0
1611,TRAIN_0_1611,Johnny," But seriously, how cheap ass is that bag?",,,0

1613,TRAIN_0_1613,Mutt, You have to open your eyes to get it in the bag!,,,0
1614,TRAIN_0_1614,Alexis, Ugh! Good. Ugh!,,,0
1615,TRAIN_0_1615,Mutt," So can I ask you a question? Why do you always get dressed up to do this? I mean, it doesn't seem very practical.",,,0
1616,TRAIN_0_1616,Alexis, Naomi Campbell wore Dolce & Gabbana couture to her community service. And just because she was picking up roadkill did not mean that she needed to look like it. And I just always really admired her courage.,,,0
1617,TRAIN_0_1617,Mutt, Um... I didn't understand a word you just said. ,,,0
1618,TRAIN_0_1618,Alexis," Besides, it's nice to uh... Change clothes every once in a while. Something you might wanna consider doing at some point.",,,0
1619,TRAIN_0_1619,Mutt, I change my clothes. They're just all the same. ,,,0
1620,TRAIN_0_1620,Alexis," Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh! Well, at least now they'll get washed. Agghhhh!",,,0
1621,TRAIN_0_1621,Mutt, Come on! Run!,,,0
1622,TRAIN_0_1622,Alexis, What? It's actually nice in here.,,,0
1623,TRAIN_1_1623,Mutt," Well, I'm not Valentino, but you know. ",SARCASTIC, He knows he is not a designer,1
1624,TRAIN_0_1624,Alexis," Okay, well, don't try and be funny about it.",,,0
1625,TRAIN_0_1625,Mutt, It just happens naturally.,,,0
1626,TRAIN_0_1626,Alexis," It's that um... When a guy can pack his whole wardrobe into an overnight bag, you just don't really think that he'd be much of an interior designer. ",,,0
1627,TRAIN_0_1627,Mutt," Don't worry, they're fresh. They're clean.",,,0
1628,TRAIN_0_1628,Alexis, Hmm. Ooh! Smell that rock-beaten freshness. What?,,,0
1629,TRAIN_0_1629,Mutt, It's just I do beat my laundry against rocks.,,,0
1630,TRAIN_0_1630,Alexis, You're a freak.,,,0
1631,TRAIN_0_1631,Johnny, What uh... what kind of lens are we using here?,,,0
1632,TRAIN_0_1632,Director, It's uh...  It's a zoom lens.,,,0

1637,TRAIN_0_1637,Director, Nah. Those are usually for feature films. ,,,0
1638,TRAIN_0_1638,Johnny," Yeah. Yeah. No, it's just I... What's the, uh, ring light situation? Do you think we need an inkey?",,,0
1639,TRAIN_0_1639,Director," Uh... I don't know, I don't know...",,,0
1640,TRAIN_0_1640,Johnny, I... are we booming this... Today?,,,0
1641,TRAIN_0_1641,Alexis, Ew! ,,,0
1642,TRAIN_0_1642,David, Shhh!,,,0
1643,TRAIN_0_1643,Alexis," Why is it dark? It's like a witch's house in here, David.",,,0
1644,TRAIN_0_1644,David, Shush!,,,0
1645,TRAIN_0_1645,Alexis, What's going on?,,,0
1646,TRAIN_0_1646,David, I am on day two of a panic attack and I have not slept at all.,,,0
1647,TRAIN_0_1647,Alexis," Babe, you know that panic attacks aren't real, right? They're just things that celebrities make up to...",,,0
1648,TRAIN_0_1648,David," No, I know. I thought so too, but they are real and I'm having one apparently.",,,0
1649,TRAIN_0_1649,Alexis," Okay. Okay. Well, while you were having your panic attack, I somehow agreed to attend a yoga class. ",,,0
1650,TRAIN_0_1650,David, That might be a good thing for me.,,,0
1651,TRAIN_0_1651,Alexis," Okay, well, I'm not gonna go though.",,,0
1652,TRAIN_0_1652,David," That might help me relax, might help me calm down.",,,0
1653,TRAIN_0_1653,Alexis," David, I just said I'm not gonna go.",,,0
1654,TRAIN_0_1654,David, I don't wanna have to bring this up... But it's my turn to take a selfish.,,,0
1655,TRAIN_0_1655,Alexis," No, David.",,,0
1656,TRAIN_0_1656,David," Yes, it is.",,,0
1657,TRAIN_0_1657,Alexis, You selfished last time.,,,0
1658,TRAIN_0_1658,David," No. Dubai, 2010, I had to pick you up from that blind date that went terribly wrong. It was a total disaster. It's my turn, and I wanna go to a yoga class.",,,0
1659,TRAIN_0_1659,Alexis," Fine, I will go, but I am not happy about this at all.",,,0
1660,TRAIN_0_1660,David, Okay. Get off my bed.,,,0
1661,TRAIN_0_1661,Alexis," Ouch, David. Ouch, David! Ugh!",,,0
1662,TRAIN_0_1662,David, Shut the curtains!,,,0
1663,TRAIN_0_1663,Moira," Oh, some people like to exaggerate, especially in our business. ",,,0
1664,TRAIN_0_1664,Make-up artist, I dunno. A lot of people on set were saying it. He's making people nervous.,,,0
1665,TRAIN_0_1665,Moira, I don't care what other's say. That's today's mantra.,,,0

1833,TRAIN_0_1833,David, It does not matter. It doesn't matter.,,,0
1834,TRAIN_0_1834,Stevie, What?,,,0
1835,TRAIN_0_1835,David, That.,,,0
1836,TRAIN_0_1836,Stevie, That's why you called me in here?,,,0
1837,TRAIN_0_1837,David," Yeah, look at it!",,,0
1838,TRAIN_0_1838,Stevie, I'm looking.,,,0
1839,TRAIN_0_1839,David, No! Look at it.,,,0
1840,TRAIN_0_1840,Stevie," Uh, it looks like a bug...",,,0
1841,TRAIN_0_1841,David, Yeah.,,,0
1842,TRAIN_0_1842,Stevie, Trapped under a glass.,,,0
1843,TRAIN_0_1843,David," I Googled that bug. It's some sort of demonic cricket that ""takes chunks out of your skin when provoked."" Chunks is the word that Google used.",,,0
1844,TRAIN_0_1844,Stevie, You Googled a bug?,,,0
1845,TRAIN_0_1845,David," Yeah. I have a thing about bugs with milky exoskeletons. I have this irrational fear they are gonna crawl into my mouth and nest at night, so...",,,0
1846,TRAIN_0_1846,Stevie," So, what do you want me to do, kill it?",,,0
1847,TRAIN_0_1847,David,"  No, I think I just need moral support while I slip a piece of paper under the glass with the bug and take the trapped bug and walk it outside. ",,,0
1848,TRAIN_0_1848,Stevie, Or we could just... kill it.,,,0
1849,TRAIN_0_1849,David," No, that's not the way to go. Oh! Oh my God! It's fleeing!",,,0
1850,TRAIN_0_1850,Stevie," Whoa, it's fast! ",,,0
1851,TRAIN_0_1851,David," It's fleeing into the bathroom. That's why you use the cup method, because you'd keep it contained! Now it's just all out!",,,0
1852,TRAIN_0_1852,Stevie, Well... I guess I don't even need to be here.,,,0
1853,TRAIN_0_1853,David," Well, it's h... Now it's hiding somewhere in the darkness Waiting for nightfall. I... I can't... I can't sleep here. I can't sleep here.",,,0
1854,TRAIN_0_1854,Stevie, Not with your mouth open anyway.,,,0
1855,TRAIN_0_1855,David, That's not a nice thing to say to me.,,,0
1856,TRAIN_0_1856,Stevie," You know, sometimes I forget what life was like before I knew you.",,,0
1857,TRAIN_0_1857,David," Okay, bye-bye! Bye. Yup.",,,0
1858,TRAIN_0_1858,Stevie, 'Kay. Hope you catch it!,,,0
1859,TRAIN_0_1859,David, I can hear it. I can hear it.,,,0
1860,TRAIN_0_1860,Moira, What the hell? Hey! Where's my towel?! John? Johnny?! Where's my towel?!,,,0
1861,TRAIN_0_1861,Jocelyn," Anyways, I asked this kid to come to the front of the class and solve this math equation and he was ""pitching a tent.""  He had a boner!",,,0
1862,TRAIN_0_1862,Johnny, Oh.,,,0
1863,TRAIN_0_1863,Jocelyn," And then I was thinking, these are young boys, these poor kids, and it can't be easy having a teacher like myself, so...",,,0
1864,TRAIN_0_1864,Johnny, Mm...,,,0
1865,TRAIN_0_1865,Jocelyn, What was your question again?,,,0
1866,TRAIN_0_1866,Johnny," You know, it's been so long I can't remember.",,,0
1867,TRAIN_0_1867,Moira," There you are, John! Where did my towel go?",,,0
1868,TRAIN_1_1868,Jocelyn," Moira! Nanaimo bars. Accidentally doubled the batch and Roland's on diabetes watch, so I thought why not share the wealth? ",RHETORICAL, Jocelyn is just pointing out that she made too many bars and wants to share them,1
1869,TRAIN_0_1869,Johnny," Well, what a lovely gesture, huh, Moira? ",,,0
1870,TRAIN_0_1870,Moira," John, I had towel and now it's disappeared! ",,,0
1871,TRAIN_0_1871,Johnny, There's a towel on the back of the door. ,,,0
1872,TRAIN_0_1872,Moira," No, that one has dirt on it!",,,0
1873,TRAIN_0_1873,Johnny, That's not dirt. I used it to kill a bug.  ,,,0
1874,TRAIN_0_1874,Moira," I'm sorry. I... I guess I'm stressed. Morning, Jocelyn!",,,0
1875,TRAIN_0_1875,Jocelyn," You know, Moira, you ever need to just go somewhere to unwind and have some pampering, I know a great place in Elmdale. ",,,0
1876,TRAIN_0_1876,Moira, Let's not and say we did.,,,0
1877,TRAIN_0_1877,Johnny," You know, honey, a little pampering might not be a bad idea. Could alleviate some of that weight your carrying around.",,,0
1878,TRAIN_0_1878,Moira, So now I'm fat and stressed?,,,0
1879,TRAIN_0_1879,Johnny, Emotional weight. Emotional.,,,0
1880,TRAIN_0_1880,Moira," John, go find a towel now, please, or I will strip out of this robe and I will air dry in the street!",,,0
1881,TRAIN_0_1881,Jocelyn," Okay, well, I'm just gonna go home. Sorry.",,,0
1882,TRAIN_0_1882,Moira," No, no, no. I didn't say I didn't want them. Thank you. ",,,0
1883,TRAIN_0_1883,Johnny, A little pampering. Great idea.,,,0
1884,TRAIN_0_1884,Jocelyn," I think so, yeah.",,,0
1885,TRAIN_0_1885,Johnny, Yeah.,,,0
1886,TRAIN_0_1886,Alexis," Hey, Twy. ",,,0
1887,TRAIN_0_1887,Alexis," Um, Twy... What is in the ""Meadow Harvest"" smoothie?",,,0
1888,TRAIN_0_1888,Twyla," Uh... you know, it changes every day. Just depends on my mood. But it's all organic, earthy ingredients.",,,0
1889,TRAIN_0_1889,Alexis," Okay, so it's like fruity or... ?",,,0
1890,TRAIN_0_1890,Twyla," Yes, it is. Yup. At times. And then other times, not.",,,0
1891,TRAIN_0_1891,Alexis," Okay! Well, today, is it more fruity or more vegetably... ? ",,,0
1892,TRAIN_0_1892,Twyla," No, I don't know. I've gotta check in the back and see what we have.",,,0
1893,TRAIN_0_1893,Alexis, So Meadow Harvest doesn't refer to anything... in particular.,,,0
1894,TRAIN_0_1894,Twyla," No, Meadow Harvest is exactly how it sounds. It just changes everyday.",,,0
1895,TRAIN_0_1895,Alexis," Mm... okay. All right. Well, I'll just um... Do that that then... the Meadow Harvest thing.",,,0
1896,TRAIN_0_1896,Twyla, Great!,,,0
1897,TRAIN_0_1897,Alexis, Thank you.,,,0
1898,TRAIN_0_1898,Ted, Hi.,,,0

1901,TRAIN_0_1901,Alexis, Excuse me?,,,0
1902,TRAIN_0_1902,Ted," Uh, she's a sweet girl but her smoothies are deadly. Um, I usually prescribe them to my patients when they're feeling a little... backed up.",,,0
1903,TRAIN_0_1903,Alexis, That's a lot of information.,,,0
1904,TRAIN_0_1904,Ted, I'm... I'm... I'm kidding. I'm actually not. I've absolutely done that... With her smoothies.,,,0
1905,TRAIN_0_1905,Alexis, So are you a doctor or... ?,,,0
1906,TRAIN_0_1906,Ted, I'm a veterinarian.,,,0
1907,TRAIN_0_1907,Alexis, Oh! It's basically the same thing.,,,0
1908,TRAIN_0_1908,Ted, Ted.,,,0
1909,TRAIN_0_1909,Alexis, Um... Alexis.,,,0
1910,TRAIN_0_1910,Ted," I know. Without sounding too forward, I've seen you around and uh... You know, I have to say, I think that you are the most beautiful girl this town's ever seen. ",,,0
1911,TRAIN_0_1911,Alexis,  What? No. I'm sure there's like another girl... somewhere.,,,0
1912,TRAIN_0_1912,Ted," No, I mean it.",,,0
1913,TRAIN_0_1913,Alexis," Yeah. Well, it's really nice of you to say.",,,0
1914,TRAIN_0_1914,Ted, I would love to take you out to dinner sometime.,,,0
1915,TRAIN_0_1915,Alexis, Oh! ,,,0

1917,TRAIN_0_1917,Alexis, Mm! Mm... Oh my God.,,,0
1918,TRAIN_0_1918,David, So... about the bug thing.,,,0
1919,TRAIN_0_1919,Stevie, No explanation necessary. You've got a thing about bugs.,,,0
1920,TRAIN_0_1920,David," No, I don't have a thing about bugs. It was one bug, and that bug was milky.",,,0
1921,TRAIN_0_1921,Stevie, So... you're a man at one with nature.,,,0
1922,TRAIN_0_1922,David," Yeah. I could not be more at one with nature. I do Coachella every year, so...",,,0
1923,TRAIN_1_1923,Stevie, Mm. Oh! So you'd be... Into coming with me on the annual Turkey shoot then. That's something that should excite you. ,SARCASTIC, Stevie knows that David would not be excited about a Turkey Shoot,1
1924,TRAIN_0_1924,David, What?,,,0
1925,TRAIN_0_1925,Stevie, The Turkey shoot?,,,0
1926,TRAIN_0_1926,David, Mm.,,,0
1927,TRAIN_0_1927,Stevie, Roland's annual thing. We go out and we hunt turkeys. Been doing it every year since I was far too young to be holding a gun.,,,0
1928,TRAIN_0_1928,David, Yeah... yes. Yeah. Let's do that.,,,0
1929,TRAIN_0_1929,Stevie, I was joking. I have a strong feeling that would not be your thing.,,,0
1930,TRAIN_0_1930,David," And what do think ""my thing"" is exactly?",,,0
1931,TRAIN_0_1931,Stevie, High thread count sheets? Colognes that smell like fireplace...,,,0
1932,TRAIN_0_1932,David," Okay. Well, it might surprise you to know that I have more than one thing, so I will happily go with you on the hunt! Nothing would make me more excited than to... Go hunting for...",,,0
1933,TRAIN_0_1933,Stevie, Turkeys.,,,0
1934,TRAIN_0_1934,David," Turkeys... with you, So... is this a tweed or a camo situation? ",,,0
1935,TRAIN_0_1935,Johnny," Okay, did anyone actually see this pillow come out of this container? ",,,0
1936,TRAIN_0_1936,Moira, Seriously?! Go. To. Hell! You're off... you're a fool!,,,0
1937,TRAIN_0_1937,Johnny," Okay, Moira, why are we doing this?  Why don't we wait for the girl to come in and help us make the bed? ",,,0
1938,TRAIN_0_1938,Moira," She never comes, John. No. b*st*rd. b*st*rd! ",,,0
1939,TRAIN_0_1939,Johnny, Jocelyn! Hi!,,,0
1940,TRAIN_0_1940,Jocelyn," Johnny. Oh good, you're here, Moira. I was just booking myself an appointment with Janine at the salon and I said to myself, ""wow, Moira really looks like she needs a pick-me-up,"" so I booked you a Mani too! Little girls spa day on me.",,,0
1941,TRAIN_0_1941,Johnny, Wow! What a nice gesture!,,,0
1942,TRAIN_0_1942,Moira, May I see a spa treatment menu?,,,0
1943,TRAIN_0_1943,Jocelyn," Oh, well, it's just a salon, so they don't really do all that kind of stuff. But she does give a mean scalp massage.",,,0
1944,TRAIN_0_1944,Moira, Really mean?,,,0
1945,TRAIN_0_1945,Jocelyn," If you requested that, I guess, yeah.",,,0
1946,TRAIN_0_1946,Johnny," Moira, this sounds too good to pass up. Please, please do this, for me. Let me rephrase that. Do it for you because you deserve...",,,0
1947,TRAIN_0_1947,Moira," Yes! My answer's yes, Jocelyn. Thank you.",,,0
1948,TRAIN_0_1948,Jocelyn, Yay!,,,0

1951,TRAIN_0_1951,Mutt, Making chili. Might do some laundry.,,,0
1952,TRAIN_0_1952,Alexis, A polite person would now ask me what I'm doing tonight.,,,0
1953,TRAIN_1_1953,Mutt, That's what this is about? ,RHETORICAL, Mutt realized that Alexis was trying to get him to ask her what she had planned for the evening,1
1954,TRAIN_0_1954,Mutt, Sorry. Um... what're you doing tonight? ,,,0
1955,TRAIN_0_1955,Alexis, Ted's taking me out.,,,0

1962,TRAIN_0_1962,Mutt, I think he has everything you're looking for in a husband. ,,,0
1963,TRAIN_0_1963,Alexis, A husband?  What am I looking for in a husband? ,,,0
1964,TRAIN_0_1964,Mutt, Money.,,,0
1965,TRAIN_0_1965,Alexis, Hmm.,,,0

1967,TRAIN_0_1967,Alexis, So Ted's taking me to Antonio's.,,,0
1968,TRAIN_0_1968,David," What's Antonio's? It's this little buffet restaurant in Elmdale, but he said that we could order off the menu. ",,,0
1969,TRAIN_0_1969,David, Are you sure you wanna be traveling so far out of town with a person you just met? ,,,0
1970,TRAIN_0_1970,Alexis," I went on a blind date to Bali with Leo, so... I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be fine. ",,,0
1971,TRAIN_0_1971,David, So who is this person?,,,0
1972,TRAIN_0_1972,Alexis, Mm... he's cute.,,,0
1973,TRAIN_0_1973,David, And... ,,,0
1974,TRAIN_0_1974,Alexis," And...  He doesn't have a trust fund, so, like, that's a refreshing change of pace for me.",,,0
1975,TRAIN_0_1975,David," Speaking of people without trust funds, what about that beardy thing that you spend time with? ",,,0
1976,TRAIN_0_1976,Alexis, What? Mutt?,,,0
1977,TRAIN_0_1977,David, Yeah. ,,,0
1978,TRAIN_0_1978,Alexis, No. Ew. It's not a thing. ,,,0
1979,TRAIN_1_1979,David, Right. ,SARCASTIC, David is making fun of Alexis for pretending to not like Mutt,1

1981,TRAIN_0_1981,Johnny," Oh, you have a what? A thing with Alexis tonight? ",,,0
1982,TRAIN_0_1982,Ted," Uh, a date.",,,0
1983,TRAIN_0_1983,Alexis,  I think that's Ted.  Why is he over there?,,,0
1984,TRAIN_0_1984,David, Because he knows how much I love it when mom and dad interrogate your boyfriends. I wonder what they're asking?,,,0
1985,TRAIN_0_1985,Alexis," No, David!",,,0
1986,TRAIN_0_1986,Johnny," Tell me, Ted, are your parents still together?",,,0

2032,TRAIN_0_2032,David, Oh.,,,0
2033,TRAIN_0_2033,Alexis," So is it, like, a small town thing to end the first date with a kiss on the cheek?",,,0
2034,TRAIN_0_2034,Alexis, What?,,,0
2035,TRAIN_0_2035,Mutt, Nothing.,,,0
2036,TRAIN_0_2036,Alexis, What?! It's not like it was a bad date or anything.,,,0

2060,TRAIN_0_2060,Ronnie, Have you ever held a gun before?,,,0
2061,TRAIN_0_2061,David," Uh, yeah, but it wasn't this... heavy, which makes me think that Elton's was actually a toy.",,,0
2062,TRAIN_0_2062,Ronnie," All right, you gotta... Treat it like it's a newborn baby. Have to admit, not into babies so it's kind of a guessing game for me. Oh, you got soft hands.",,,0
2063,TRAIN_0_2063,David," Okay, thank you. Thanks.",,,0
2064,TRAIN_0_2064,Stevie, You don't have to do this.,,,0
2065,TRAIN_0_2065,David," Do what? Have fun? Smell like manure? Get called ""scrimpy""? Who wouldn't wanna sign up for this? ",SARCASTIC & RHETORICAL," David thinks the entire experience is ridiculous, and is making fun of Stevie for participating",0
2066,TRAIN_0_2066,Stevie, Yeah.,,,0
2067,TRAIN_0_2067,Moira," Oh, uh, Jocelyn, would you grab us a table while I speak with my husband, please.",,,0

2076,TRAIN_0_2076,Johnny," Oh my God, that's right! Why Jocelyn?",,,0
2077,TRAIN_0_2077,Moira, Because everyone who comes out of that salon looks just like Jocelyn. ,,,0
2078,TRAIN_0_2078,Johnny, Wow! And is that you? Is that your... wig? ,,,0
2079,TRAIN_1_2079,Moira," No, it's a dead possum. ",SARCASTIC, It is obviously not a dead possum. Moira is making fun of the fact that her wig looks bad ,1

2081,TRAIN_0_2081,Johnny," Yes, she is. Yes. So what happened? I can't believe you're wearing this. ",,,0
2082,TRAIN_0_2082,Moira," This is what I get for being nice, John. I'm doing this for Jocelyn because she paid for it, and it was her ""little treat,"" and I didn't have the heart to rip it off my head much less torch it. So, now, until I get in the shower, I'm stuck looking like every other inmate in this godforsaken prison.",,,0
2083,TRAIN_0_2083,Johnny, She's coming over. I just told a joke.,,,0
2084,TRAIN_0_2084,Moira, You did?  You did!,,,0
2085,TRAIN_0_2085,Jocelyn, What do you think of your beautiful wife?,,,0

2089,TRAIN_0_2089,Jocelyn, Sad?! You think this is a sad look?,,,0
2090,TRAIN_0_2090,Moira and Johnny, No! No.,,,0
2091,TRAIN_0_2091,Moira," Not the look. No, Jocelyn, I'm talking about the inner sadness that would come from... From living in such a... We have to get drinks. Several drinks, don't you think? Let's celebrate!",,,0

2097,TRAIN_0_2097,Bob,"  Just point and shoot, David.",,,0
2098,TRAIN_0_2098,David," Hard to do when you're talking, Bob.",,,0

2100,TRAIN_0_2100,Stevie," Bob, you're talking.",,,0
2101,TRAIN_0_2101,Bob, What?,,,0
2102,TRAIN_0_2102,Stevie, Stop talking!,,,0

2106,TRAIN_0_2106,Roland, And... in the neck.,,,0
2107,TRAIN_0_2107,David, It's still moving.,,,0
2108,TRAIN_0_2108,Ronnie, Just let it bleed out.,,,0
2109,TRAIN_0_2109,Stevie, You okay?,,,0
2110,TRAIN_0_2110,David, I feel like one of the Manson girls.,,,0
2111,TRAIN_0_2111,Ronnie, First time's tough. Even tougher when you shoot it in the neck 'cause then it takes longer to die. ,,,0
2112,TRAIN_0_2112,Stevie," Okay, not helping, Ronnie.",,,0
2113,TRAIN_1_2113,David," So, now what? Do we just... Wait until its Turkey family comes and shoot them too? ",RHETORICAL, David is making fun of the whole Turkey Shooting process,1

2118,TRAIN_0_2118,Moira," Oh, Jocelyn, 'tis I who owes you a big thank you.",,,0
2119,TRAIN_0_2119,Jocelyn, I also wanted to apologize for Janine ruining your wig.,,,0
2120,TRAIN_0_2120,Moira," No, don't be silly. I was... I was about to... Find a shower cap.",,,0
2121,TRAIN_0_2121,Jocelyn," I know you hate your hair, Moira. Almost as much as you hate this town. But there's a possibility you could be here a really long time. May I offer you something? The people here are just trying to help you, and there'll be days when your wigs need conditioning... Or one of your fashion-y blouses shrinks in the dryer, and you'll have to go to Janine's or get a shirt at the Blouse Barn, just like the rest of us.  And I would hate for that day to catch you by surprise. ",,,0
2122,TRAIN_0_2122,Moira," I don't hate this town, Jocelyn. It's just not mine, and this is not my hair.",,,0
2123,TRAIN_0_2123,Jocelyn,  I know. It's a wig. ,,,0
2124,TRAIN_0_2124,Moira," It's not my style. You? On you, it's adorable. You have a look that says, ""Hi. I'm Jocelyn, and I know who I am!"" For that, you're very fortunate. You are. I don't who I am from one moment to the next. So honestly, dear, I envy you, all right? ",,,0
2125,TRAIN_1_2125,Moira," But if you ever... Ever catch me shopping at the Blouse Barn, you must shoot me in the temple. ",SARCASTIC, Moira does not want Jocelyn to shoot her. Moira is just pointing out that the Blouse Barn is not her style,1
2126,TRAIN_0_2126,Moira, Promise?,,,0
2127,TRAIN_0_2127,Jocelyn, Promise.,,,0
2128,TRAIN_0_2128,Moira," My son is hunting right now with your husband, so I... I know you people have guns.",,,0
2129,TRAIN_0_2129,David," What about what we just did, makes you think, ""yeah, you know what? I wanna do this year after year after year""? Was it the lying in the mud part or was it... Wearing the clothes that smell like menthol cigarettes and body odor? ",SARCASTIC & RHETORICAL, David is making fun of Stevie for participating in the Turkey Shoot,0
2130,TRAIN_0_2130,Stevie, 'cause usually it's more fun. Usually Ray comes and... gets wasted and... Spends the whole day singing Carole King ballads.,,,0
2131,TRAIN_0_2131,Moira,"  David, I... Need a towel, please.",,,0
2132,TRAIN_0_2132,David, Is that a new wig? Because... You are reminding me of someone.,,,0

2138,TRAIN_0_2138,Moira, Jocelyn. And what's your excuse?,,,0
2139,TRAIN_0_2139,David," Oh, um... I shot a bird in the neck today. It was an indelible image that I had scarred in my mind until I saw what was... Happening up there with you.  So... thank you. I'm gonna get your towel.",,,0
2140,TRAIN_0_2140,David," Mom, can you come here, please? ",,,0
2141,TRAIN_0_2141,Moira, What?!,,,0
2142,TRAIN_0_2142,David," I said, come here, please!",,,0
2143,TRAIN_0_2143,Moira, You come here! ,,,0
2144,TRAIN_0_2144,David, We got a big box sent to us! ,,,0
2145,TRAIN_0_2145,Moira, We did?,,,0
2146,TRAIN_0_2146,David, It's a package!,,,0
2147,TRAIN_0_2147,Moira, Who's it from? ,,,0
2148,TRAIN_0_2148,David, I don't know.,,,0

2150,TRAIN_0_2150,David," ""Congratulations on your Allez Vous Starter Kit.""",,,0
2151,TRAIN_0_2151,Moira, That frigid whore!,,,0
2152,TRAIN_0_2152,David, What's Allez Vous?,,,0
2153,TRAIN_0_2153,Moira," It's a scam, it's her stupid cosmetics company! It's a pyramid scheme for desperate housewives, and struggling actors!",,,0
2154,TRAIN_0_2154,David," Well, how much can we make from this?",,,0
2155,TRAIN_0_2155,Moira," David, it's an insult, we're sending it back!",,,0
2156,TRAIN_0_2156,David," Well, apparently you can win an Audi.",,,0
2157,TRAIN_0_2157,Moira, What colour?,,,0
2158,TRAIN_0_2158,David," A Champagne Audi, look at that! ",,,0
2159,TRAIN_0_2159,Moira, As if you could ever sell enough of this crap to get a car.,,,0
2160,TRAIN_0_2160,David," Well, Kristi Stubbs and her team out of Montreal have sold enough to get the car, so... Moira"," don't believe everything you read, dear, please.",,0
2161,TRAIN_0_2161,Moira, Burn it! Except this mascara.,,,0
2162,TRAIN_1_2162,Johnny," So Ray can't lend me his car today, because he has to drive his 92-year-old mother somewhere. Where does a 92-year-old woman need to go?! ",RHETORICAL, Johnny is implying that a 92-year-old woman would likely just sit at home and not need to go anywhere,1
2163,TRAIN_0_2163,Moira," I don't know, John, perhaps the hospital?",,,0
2164,TRAIN_0_2164,Johnny," Yeah, well, it's just I needed that car to get to my appointment today.",,,0
2165,TRAIN_0_2165,Moira, What appointment?,,,0

2169,TRAIN_0_2169,Moira," Well, I think you're brave, and while I didn't see us living off of food stamps, I think there is something very masculine about the way you're taking control of this situation. ",,,0
2170,TRAIN_0_2170,Johnny," Sweetheart, I'm about to beg for a truck, in order to beg for money, I think you've gotta raise that masculinity bar just... just a little.",,,0

2183,TRAIN_0_2183,Johnny," well, that's very, very nice, that's so nice. ",,,0
2184,TRAIN_0_2184,Roland," Listen, as the owner of the truck, would you do me one favour, though? When you return it, can you bring the seats back up, the way I had 'em, I'd appreciate that.",,,0
2185,TRAIN_0_2185,Johnny, I do. ,,,0

2281,TRAIN_0_2281,Roland," Well Johnny, it's gonna be awfully hard for me to get you to this meeting if I don't know where we're going! I mean, why is this such a big secret?",,,0

2283,TRAIN_0_2283,Roland," What's the big rush here? I don't get that, either!",,,0
2284,TRAIN_0_2284,Johnny," The office closes at four o'clock, that's all.",,,0
2285,TRAIN_0_2285,Roland, What office are you talking about?,,,0
2286,TRAIN_0_2286,Johnny," The financial guy that I'm seeing, his office...",,,0

2299,TRAIN_0_2299,Ted, Your mom asked me to come.,,,0

2305,TRAIN_0_2305,Alexis, Can I come with you?,,,0
2306,TRAIN_0_2306,Ted, I don't think so.,,,0
2307,TRAIN_1_2307,Alexis, Now you get all decisive-y? ,RHETORICAL, Alexis is making fun of Ted for suddenly being firm,1
2308,TRAIN_1_2308,David," I was just so excited about Allez Vous' exclusive anti-aging formula, and rejuvenation serums. Alexis, you'd like this product. It's all about aging, and dry skin. ",SARCASTIC," David is making fun of Alexis, saying she has dry and aging skin when she does not",1

2316,TRAIN_0_2316,Marnie, Get some money?,,,0

2330,TRAIN_0_2330,Marnie, We can't give you money unless you contributed to the program. ,,,0
2331,TRAIN_0_2331,Johnny," I don't think you're understanding, I employed people, hundreds of people. You see, and now I'm unemployed.",,,0
2332,TRAIN_0_2332,Marnie, But that doesn't mean you qualify for unemployment.,,,0
2333,TRAIN_0_2333,Johnny, I lost my job! ,,,0
2334,TRAIN_0_2334,Marnie, You lost your business.,,,0
2335,TRAIN_1_2335,Johnny," Okay, let me walk you through this. You see, I need money to get back on my feet so I can employ more people, that might actually end up saving you money in the long run now, am I the only one who understands how an economy works around here?!  ",RHETORICAL, Johnny is expressing his frustration with the unemployment system,1
2336,TRAIN_0_2336,Marnie," Let me walk you through this, Mr. Rose. Unless you can prove that you contributed, you don't qualify. If you were laid off, or fired, or could show that you were out looking for work, that would be a different story. ",,,0
2337,TRAIN_0_2337,Johnny," I'd like to talk to your supervisor, please.",,,0
2338,TRAIN_0_2338,Marnie, I am the supervisor.,,,0

2352,TRAIN_0_2352,David, What?!,,,0
2353,TRAIN_0_2353,Jocelyn," The Allez Vous craze hit the town a couple years ago, and you should've seen us! In two weeks we had sold everything to the other half of town, and vice versa.",,,0
2354,TRAIN_0_2354,Alexis, That's... that's funny.,,,0
2355,TRAIN_0_2355,Jocelyn," It became a bit incestuous, yeah, very small sales pool. It became literally impossible to climb the ladder. Anywho, good luck!",,,0
2356,TRAIN_0_2356,Johnny," Somehow, we got off on the wrong foot. Okay? So if I in any way gave you the impression that-",,,0
2357,TRAIN_0_2357,Marnie," I am locking up now, Mr. Rose.",,,0

2360,TRAIN_0_2360,Roland," Well Marnie, hello. How are you?",,,0
2361,TRAIN_0_2361,Marnie, Haven't seen you in a while.,,,0
2362,TRAIN_0_2362,Roland," Yeah, it has been a while, hasn't it? Marnie and I were, um, how shall I say it? ""Close friends"" in high school.  Isn't that right, Marnie?",,,0
2363,TRAIN_0_2363,Marnie," Okay, that's enough of that.",,,0
2364,TRAIN_0_2364,Roland,  Marnie likes the bad boys.,,,0
2365,TRAIN_0_2365,Marnie, Roland!,,,0
2366,TRAIN_0_2366,Roland, Are you taking care of my bad boy over there?,,,0
2367,TRAIN_0_2367,Johnny," No, she's being quite obstinate about this whole situation. I'm getting nothing!",,,0
2368,TRAIN_0_2368,Marnie," Well, unfortunately, Mr. Rose doesn't qualify for unemployment because he's never had a job.",,,0
2369,TRAIN_0_2369,Roland," Oh well, didn't he tell you about the job he was doing for me?",,,0
2370,TRAIN_0_2370,Marnie," No, what job?",,,0
2371,TRAIN_0_2371,Roland, You didn't tell her?,,,0
2372,TRAIN_0_2372,Johnny," No-no, not specifically, I-I-uh...",,,0
2373,TRAIN_0_2373,Marnie," Well, that's important information, Mr. Rose. You working for Roland makes you an employee.",,,0
2374,TRAIN_0_2374,Roland, Yes!,,,0
2375,TRAIN_0_2375,Johnny, Oh! I forgot.,,,0
2376,TRAIN_0_2376,Marnie," Well, what were your duties?",,,0
2377,TRAIN_0_2377,Johnny," Well, I was in more of a consulting position.",,,0
2378,TRAIN_0_2378,Roland," Oh!  No, no, no, no, no. It was not a consulting position, he was my assistant, he was like my little guy Friday. He would fetch things for me, I'd tell him where to go and he'd go running off, and fetching things for me. What were some of the things you fetched? You fetched like uh...",,,0
2379,TRAIN_0_2379,Johnny, Coffee.,,,0
2380,TRAIN_0_2380,Roland," Coffee, you'd get that, and um...",,,0
2381,TRAIN_0_2381,Johnny, I get his coffee...,,,0
2382,TRAIN_0_2382,Roland, Sometimes you'd have to... ,,,0
2383,TRAIN_0_2383,Johnny, Get a hankie.,,,0

2390,TRAIN_0_2390,Roland," Oh, there was something with the boots.",,,0
2391,TRAIN_0_2391,Johnny, Polish them every once in a while.,,,0
2392,TRAIN_0_2392,Roland," Every now and then, he had to do that, too. He was a hell of a worker and I really, really needed him, because you know how busy I can get.",,,0
2393,TRAIN_0_2393,Marnie,  Yes I do.,,,0
2394,TRAIN_0_2394,Roland," Yeah, unfortunately I had to can his ass though, because of that whole ""cut the gravy"" thing, so.",,,0
2395,TRAIN_0_2395,Marnie, Oh. Well... I think we can make this work.,,,0
2396,TRAIN_0_2396,Alexis, Hey... I come in peace.,,,0
2397,TRAIN_0_2397,Ted, What's this?,,,0
2398,TRAIN_0_2398,Alexis," I don't know, it's a pre shave follicle mask or something, I took it from the pile of product that nobody bought. ",,,0
2399,TRAIN_0_2399,Ted, Sweet gesture.,,,0
2400,TRAIN_0_2400,Alexis, I'm sorry for being rude.  You have to understand that you're the first nice guy that I've dated.,,,0
2401,TRAIN_0_2401,Ted," Lex, I am not always nice.",,,0
2402,TRAIN_0_2402,Alexis, I just really want my family to like you.,,,0
2403,TRAIN_0_2403,Ted, They don't like me?,,,0
2404,TRAIN_0_2404,Alexis," No, they do! They do, they've just always seen nice as a sign of weakness, they take advantage of nice.",,,0
2405,TRAIN_0_2405,Ted," No, nice does not always mean weak, it's...",,,0
2406,TRAIN_0_2406,Alexis," Okay, so get mad, then. Say something super mean.",,,0
2407,TRAIN_0_2407,Ted," What, I can't just turn it on in an instant, like you can.",,,0
2408,TRAIN_0_2408,Alexis," Okay well, consider it a kind of role play then, and just let it out. ",,,0
2409,TRAIN_0_2409,Ted, I-I don't know... I find your brother can be a little pretentious sometimes.,,,0
2410,TRAIN_0_2410,Alexis," Yes, yes! He is so pretentious, and it is so gross. This is good, keep going.",,,0
2411,TRAIN_0_2411,Ted," Well, and your mother... Seems to be a little uninformed at times.",,,0
2412,TRAIN_0_2412,Alexis," She's uninformed most of the time. This is great, this is really good. Keep going!",,,0
2413,TRAIN_0_2413,Ted," Well, and you, what about you? Are you just going to sit around all day, while I work and buy you dinners? You've gotta go out there and get a job... Too far.",,,0
2414,TRAIN_0_2414,Alexis, Mm-hmm.,,,0
2415,TRAIN_0_2415,Ted," It's too far, okay.",,,0
2416,TRAIN_0_2416,Alexis, That's too far.,,,0

2429,TRAIN_0_2429,Roland," Don't you worry about it, Johnny, I'm happy to do it. Why don't you just get me a little wiper fluid, and we'll call it even, okay?",,,0
2430,TRAIN_0_2430,Johnny," Okay, wiper fluid, you got it. ",,,0
2431,TRAIN_0_2431,Roland, And also maybe a Kleenex caddy? I've always wanted one of those. ,,,0
2432,TRAIN_0_2432,Johnny, That's funny!,,,0
2433,TRAIN_0_2433,Roland," It is, but I'm not joking.  All right, one Kleenex caddy, and wiper fluid. ",,,0
2434,TRAIN_0_2434,Johnny," Roland, you screwed it up! Roland! Roland! Son of a bitch! ",,,0

2500,TRAIN_0_2500,David, You're just gonna leave me here with these people?! ,,,0
2501,TRAIN_0_2501,Alexis, Yeah. Like I don't feel good about it.,,,0

2504,TRAIN_0_2504,Bob, Oh... you know. Not bad.,,,0
2505,TRAIN_0_2505,Twyla," You know, they say death is just life except you're not here.  You're somewhere else, you know? But... But that's okay because at least you're somewhere, you know? But when does... When does somewhere become there? And when does there become here? And I... it ",,,0

2526,TRAIN_0_2526,Johnny," Oh no. No, no. Not really. Not really. I mean, I'm good one on one, but not-not good in a public situation. I clam up pret-pretty good.",,,0

2537,TRAIN_0_2537,David," My God, they're so skaggy. Hmm. Wait, so you're related to Carl? ",,,0
2538,TRAIN_0_2538,Stevie, Not genetically.  My mom's sister was married to Carl. Carl is Sean's step-dad. ,,,0
2539,TRAIN_0_2539,David, And was that a factor in the cause of death?,,,0
2540,TRAIN_0_2540,Stevie," I wouldn't be surprised. They broke up right before Sean got Bree pregnant.  Or someone got Bree pregnant. I mean, Bree's not exactly fussy when it comes to introducing men to her vagina. ",,,0
2541,TRAIN_1_2541,David, Mm. Charming. ,SARCASTIC, David does not think that Bree is charming,1

2545,TRAIN_0_2545,Ted," Uh... that's the Febreeze. I was... I was eating Indian last night, so...",,,0
2546,TRAIN_0_2546,Alexis, So much better than the motel. At least you know what the smell is.,,,0

2550,TRAIN_0_2550,Alexis, They're so...,,,0
2551,TRAIN_1_2551,Ted," Well, Macy and Fifer are just staying with me for a couple of weeks until they get back on their feet. Isn't that right, Fifey? ",RHETORICAL, Ted does not expect a response from the dog,1

2553,TRAIN_0_2553,Alexis, Yeah... Is that a diaper on that little cutie?,,,0
2554,TRAIN_0_2554,Ted, Yup. Oh! You know what though? Whoa 'kay. This is just... This is because she's... She's... She's scared right now. But don't worry. I can tell that you are gonna win them over.,,,0

2559,TRAIN_0_2559,Moira," John, you're speaking at the funeral?",,,0
2560,TRAIN_0_2560,Johnny, The man was weeping. What was I supposed to do?,,,0
2561,TRAIN_0_2561,Moira," You take his hands in yours, you look him in the eye, and say, ""no.""",,,0
2562,TRAIN_0_2562,Johnny, What do you say about guy you couldn't care less about?,,,0
2563,TRAIN_0_2563,Moira," Oh, it's Gord what's-his-name's funeral all over again.",,,0
2564,TRAIN_0_2564,Johnny, Who's Gord what's-his-name?,,,0
2565,TRAIN_0_2565,Moira," Exactly. He was some kind of crew-person on Sunrise Bay. I made an obligatory appearance at the service and his hysterical girlfriend cornered me into saying a few words. I didn't have a thought in my head, so I just stood up and sang ""Danny Boy."" Not a dry eye in the house.",,,0
2566,TRAIN_0_2566,Johnny, Huh...,,,0
2567,TRAIN_0_2567,Alexis," God, I love this bed. I'm so glad you're not my brother.",,,0
2568,TRAIN_0_2568,Ted," Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty glad about that too. But let me assure you, tonight it is just you and me. Um...",,,0
2569,TRAIN_0_2569,Alexis," Hey, the little guy is looking at us.",,,0
2570,TRAIN_0_2570,Ted," Oh, yeah, dogs sometimes do that.",,,0
2571,TRAIN_0_2571,Alexis, Um... maybe we could invite it to... go? Go away.,,,0
2572,TRAIN_0_2572,Ted," Oh, she's fine. She's fine. She's fine. ",,,0
2573,TRAIN_1_2573,Ted," Oh, now you want in on the action, too, huh? ",RHETORICAL, Ted does not expect a response from the dogs,1
2574,TRAIN_0_2574,Alexis," Okay, the... the big one is sniffing the diaper. Does... does that mean it's full?",,,0
2575,TRAIN_0_2575,Ted, Okay.,,,0
2576,TRAIN_0_2576,Alexis, What is... ?,,,0
2577,TRAIN_1_2577,Ted," Okay, you guys, just give us a little bit of time here and then you can come sleep with us, okay? Okay? Okay, where were we? ",RHETORICAL, Ted and Alexis were kissing. He does not need to actually be reminded of this,1
2578,TRAIN_0_2578,Alexis, Hmm... Mm...,,,0

2587,TRAIN_0_2587,David, I don't wanna be invited to this one.,,,0

2622,TRAIN_0_2622,Johnny," Oh, that's very nice. Boy, what a beautiful day for a... funeral. Bob... in case I wanna mention this in my remarks, how-how did Carl go?",,,0
2623,TRAIN_0_2623,Bob," Well, it was a bit of a freak accident, really. Apparently, he was trying to unhook his belt from the ceiling fan and... apparently it... It got knotted around his neck. ",,,0
2624,TRAIN_0_2624,Johnny,  What? ,,,0
2625,TRAIN_0_2625,Bob," Yeah, you know, you'd think the whole thing would've come down, you know, keeping a fan and a body spinning up there for two days.  But uh... Carl found the studs on that one. ",,,0

2638,TRAIN_0_2638,David, Mm-mm.,,,0
2639,TRAIN_0_2639,Stevie," Good. But now I'm worried I made out with someone else. Uh, it's kind of my go-to when I'm a little boozy.",,,0
2640,TRAIN_0_2640,David," Mm. Mine's shame eating, so yours sounds more fun. ",,,0
2641,TRAIN_0_2641,David, Huh. Um... Is this your thong or... ?,,,0

2650,TRAIN_0_2650,Minister," Thank you for that, Shannon. Nothing says we'll miss you like an excerpt from ""Breaking Dawn,"" one of Carl's favourites of the Twilight movies. Now, to say a few words, I'd like to bring up a close friend and one of Carl's personal heroes... Johnny Rose.",,,0
2651,TRAIN_0_2651,Johnny," Thank you... minister. Carl... What to say about Carl... ? Once so full of life and now... lying... very, very close to me. What a terrible thing death is...  And yet, for Carl, pretty much an all-consuming thing at this point.  He-he was a- he was a man who loved... A good sweater I'm told.  And-and he loved the feel of big tool in his hand, am I right, Bob?  And I wonder, when Carl was spinning around on that ceiling fan that he was so very proud of, was he ever thinking of this town... where he was born where he lived, and where he died... Where he died.  But I-I-I'm not up here today to speak about dying in Schitt's Creek.  I'm-I'm here-I'm-",,,0

2720,TRAIN_0_2720,Stevie, What? No!,,,0
2721,TRAIN_0_2721,Johnny, Are you in danger? Blink if you're in danger.,,,0
2722,TRAIN_0_2722,David, Stevie!,,,0
2723,TRAIN_0_2723,Stevie, That's really not necessary.,,,0
2724,TRAIN_0_2724,Johnny," Okay well, I'm going back to my room now... And I'm gonna call the police!",,,0
2725,TRAIN_0_2725,Stevie," No, Mr. Rose, please don't call the police!",,,0
2726,TRAIN_0_2726,David," Dad, please just take the towels, and go! ",,,0

2728,TRAIN_0_2728,Alexis," Um, what happened with Stop! What um... Okay, what happened-",,,0
2729,TRAIN_0_2729,David, You said something about-,,,0
2730,TRAIN_0_2730,Alexis, You slept with Stevie!,,,0
2731,TRAIN_0_2731,David," What, did dad tell the whole motel?!",,,0
2732,TRAIN_0_2732,Alexis," Well no, but I heard through the wall, 'cause he was doing his high pitched voice. So, was it cute for you, or what?",,,0
2733,TRAIN_0_2733,David," It was fine, it was weird, it was weird, it was good.",,,0
2734,TRAIN_0_2734,Alexis, Love that.,,,0
2735,TRAIN_0_2735,David, It was good but weird.,,,0
2736,TRAIN_0_2736,Alexis," I love that! Um, okay, so I have to tell you this, um, Ted wants to meet my friends, So I think it's getting kinda serious. ",,,0
2737,TRAIN_0_2737,David, It's been two weeks.,,,0
2738,TRAIN_0_2738,Alexis," I know. What's your point, David?! Ugh! So anyway, We're throwing a party at his place tonight, so I would say be there around like, seven. ",,,0
2739,TRAIN_0_2739,David," That's presumptuous, what if I have plans? ",,,0
2740,TRAIN_0_2740,Alexis," That's so cute, bring Stevie!",,,0
2741,TRAIN_0_2741,David," No, I'm not bringing Stevie, it's not a good time, I'm gonna let the dust settle on that...",,,0
2742,TRAIN_0_2742,Alexis," Well okay, but Ted's already getting groceries, and I may... I already invited her. So it's gonna be fun! David, it's gonna be so much fun!",,,0
2743,TRAIN_0_2743,Moira," Children, children! Your father and I have something to discuss.",,,0
2744,TRAIN_0_2744,David," I'm really busy right now, though.",,,0
2745,TRAIN_0_2745,Alexis," I can't right now, I don't have time.",,,0
2746,TRAIN_0_2746,Moira," We understand you have found some local friends with whom to spend ""time"" with ",,,0
2747,TRAIN_0_2747,David, Oh my God!,,,0
2748,TRAIN_0_2748,Alexis," Okay, I can't deal with this right now-",,,0
2749,TRAIN_0_2749,Moira, And that's fine.,,,0
2750,TRAIN_0_2750,Johnny, But we do have to be careful with our hearts and our parts.,,,0
2751,TRAIN_0_2751,Moira, Because a podunk baby out of wedlock is not something your father and I can afford to negotiate at this moment. ,,,0
2752,TRAIN_0_2752,David," Well, that's crazy, because all I want to negotiate right now is some podunk baby out of wedlock! So- ",,,0
2753,TRAIN_1_2753,Alexis," Okay, hi. Hi!  I don't wanna sound negative about this at all, but I think that you two really actually need to consider the idea of um... Getting a life. ",SARCASTIC, David does not want to have a baby,1
2754,TRAIN_0_2754,Johnny," Alexis, I would not concern yourself with your mother and me, because we have a flourishing social life here. ",,,0
2755,TRAIN_0_2755,David," Walking over to the cafe and ordering a tuna melt is hardly what I would call a flourishing social life.  Oh, that's funny. That's funny. ",,,0
2756,TRAIN_0_2756,Alexis," Yeah, it's just that you're so involved in our lives right now, and that was fine when we were child actors for a little bit, but now David and I are grown up adults, and we're just feeling very like, um... ",,,0
2757,TRAIN_0_2757,David, Suffocated.,,,0
2758,TRAIN_0_2758,Alexis, Suffocated.,,,0
2759,TRAIN_0_2759,Johnny, Suffocated?!,,,0
2760,TRAIN_0_2760,Moira," Wait, stop, stop! We came in here to speak about you two! ",,,0
2761,TRAIN_0_2761,Alexis, What could you possibly have to say now? ,,,0
2762,TRAIN_0_2762,Moira," Well, now I don't remember.",,,0
2763,TRAIN_0_2763,Johnny," Yeah, I don't remember.",,,0
2764,TRAIN_0_2764,David, Oh my God! Thanks. ,,,0
2765,TRAIN_0_2765,Johnny," You know, the more I think about it, the more I wonder whether David's whole... ""Sexually adventurous"" thing was just a phase. ",,,0
2766,TRAIN_0_2766,Moira, It's not a phase.,,,0
2767,TRAIN_0_2767,Johnny," Well, you know, he was very influenced in college, all those haircuts.",,,0
2768,TRAIN_0_2768,Moira," It's not a phase, John! The kids are right, we've been talking about them far more than I care to do. ",,,0
2769,TRAIN_0_2769,Roland," Something about that top that just knocks me out, baby! Hey, how you doing? Ah, okay...",,,0

2773,TRAIN_0_2773,Johnny," Moira, what're you doing?",,,0
2774,TRAIN_0_2774,Moira," Attempting to be social, support me. Won't you, please?",,,0
2775,TRAIN_0_2775,Roland," Hey, sure! ",,,0
2776,TRAIN_0_2776,Johnny, Hi!,,,0

2783,TRAIN_0_2783,Roland, Yes... ,,,0
2784,TRAIN_0_2784,Moira," Jonathan and I were just saying, wouldn't it be fun to have the mayor and his wife over for cocktails and charades tonight! ",,,0
2785,TRAIN_0_2785,Johnny, Yes... Tonight.,,,0
2786,TRAIN_0_2786,Roland," Oh, yeah, no, unfortunately that's not gonna work for us. We're having a huge party tonight at our place.",,,0
2787,TRAIN_0_2787,Jocelyn, Ton of people coming to our house. Whoo!,,,0
2788,TRAIN_0_2788,Roland," Oh yeah, big! But we're free any other night, other than tonight.",,,0
2789,TRAIN_0_2789,Stevie, Hey.,,,0
2790,TRAIN_0_2790,David," So, um... So the other... so, last night um... That was just a...",,,0
2791,TRAIN_0_2791,Stevie, Was a one time thing.,,,0
2792,TRAIN_0_2792,David, That was a one time ,,,0
2793,TRAIN_0_2793,Stevie, Like a blip.,,,0
2794,TRAIN_0_2794,David, Just a blip... Just a blip blop. Just a...  My sister said that she uh...,,,0
2795,TRAIN_0_2795,Stevie," Invited me to Ted's, yeah.",,,0
2796,TRAIN_0_2796,David," Yes, she'd asked you to Ted's.",,,0
2797,TRAIN_0_2797,Stevie, Yeah.,,,0
2798,TRAIN_0_2798,David," Yep, um...",,,0
2799,TRAIN_0_2799,Stevie," Okay, well I'm gonna leave from here, should I just come by your place, and get you when I'm done? ",,,0
2800,TRAIN_0_2800,David," Yeah, we can go together, 'cause that's... That's like, a totally normal thing for us to do.",,,0
2801,TRAIN_0_2801,Stevie, Why would it not be?,,,0
2802,TRAIN_0_2802,David," No, it's not! I mean... So um...",,,0
2803,TRAIN_0_2803,Stevie," So, cool!",,,0
2804,TRAIN_0_2804,David," Yeah, no, this is a good thing. So I'll just um... I'll see you when you swing by, so...",,,0
2805,TRAIN_0_2805,Stevie," Yeah, I'll be- okay, all right, blippity blop. Blippity blip.",,,0
2806,TRAIN_0_2806,Alexis, You're quiet today.,,,0
2807,TRAIN_0_2807,Mutt, Am I?,,,0
2808,TRAIN_0_2808,Alexis," It's just that you're not talking, and it's annoying, because I'm bored.",,,0
2809,TRAIN_0_2809,Mutt," Can't we just think and work, or do we always have to talk? ",,,0
2810,TRAIN_0_2810,Alexis," Okay, you're being super sketchy and emo right now, what is going on?",,,0
2811,TRAIN_0_2811,Mutt, Have you ever been in a relationship where you find yourself cheating ,,,0
2812,TRAIN_0_2812,Alexis, Yes!,,,0
2813,TRAIN_0_2813,Mutt, With someone in your dreams?,,,0
2814,TRAIN_0_2814,Alexis," Oh, what? Oh. Um... you know that if it's in your dreams, or over the clothes, it's not cheating, right?",,,0
2815,TRAIN_0_2815,Mutt," Yeah well, it's been happening a lot lately, and then I look over and I see Twyla, and I feel bad. ",,,0
2816,TRAIN_0_2816,Alexis," Also, Ted is throwing a party tonight, maybe that's something exciting for you two to do together? ",,,0
2817,TRAIN_0_2817,Mutt, That's probably not such a good idea.,,,0
2818,TRAIN_0_2818,Roland, Mmm... Oh. Oh! Oh.,,,0
2819,TRAIN_0_2819,Moira," I'm sorry, what kind of event are you hosting this evening?",,,0
2820,TRAIN_0_2820,Roland,"  Event! Oh, it's more of a soiree.",,,0
2821,TRAIN_0_2821,Jocelyn," He's just teasing, it's our annual Hawaiian night.  Pineapples, pig on the spit, the whole nine yards. ",,,0
2822,TRAIN_0_2822,Johnny," Oh, you roast pigs?",,,0
2823,TRAIN_0_2823,Jocelyn, We do!,,,0
2824,TRAIN_0_2824,Roland, Sure do. ,,,0
2825,TRAIN_0_2825,Jocelyn, We have a big one hanging in the garage.,,,0
2826,TRAIN_0_2826,Roland, Hm-hm.,,,0
2827,TRAIN_0_2827,Johnny," Wow, it sounds like um... quite the evening.",,,0
2828,TRAIN_0_2828,Moira, So whose pig do we have to slaughter to get an invite? ,,,0
2829,TRAIN_1_2829,Jocelyn," Oh my goodness, well, um...  We just didn't think that you and Johnny would wanna come, so...",RHETORICAL, Moira wants an invite to the party. She doesn’t want to slaughter a pig,1
2830,TRAIN_0_2830,Moira," Well, that's a touch presumptuous Jocelyn, why would we not want to be involved in a themed party in your yard? ",,,0
2831,TRAIN_0_2831,Johnny, Right.,,,0
2832,TRAIN_0_2832,Roland," Well, I mean, for one thing, you know, the two of you are a little...",,,0
2833,TRAIN_0_2833,Johnny, A little what?,,,0
2834,TRAIN_0_2834,Roland,"  Hoity-toity. All right, I've said it.",,,0
2835,TRAIN_0_2835,Jocelyn," We didn't think that you'd wanna hang out with ""regular people.""",,,0
2836,TRAIN_0_2836,Johnny, What?,,,0
2837,TRAIN_0_2837,Moira, Regular people?! Regular people are how Rose Video became such a-,,,0
2838,TRAIN_0_2838,Johnny," Right, c-careful, Moira.",,,0
2839,TRAIN_0_2839,Moira," Regular people! I mean, they made us who we were-  What am I trying to say?",,,0
2840,TRAIN_0_2840,Johnny, We love regular people. W-we love regular people.,,,0
2841,TRAIN_0_2841,Jocelyn," Well, by all means then, the two of you are invited. ",,,0
2842,TRAIN_0_2842,Moira, Thank you! ,,,0
2843,TRAIN_0_2843,Stevie," So, just to be clear, um, I'm a red wine drinker. ",,,0
2844,TRAIN_0_2844,David, That's fine.,,,0
2845,TRAIN_0_2845,Stevie," Okay, cool. But uh, I only drink red wine. ",,,0
2846,TRAIN_0_2846,David, Okay.,,,0
2847,TRAIN_0_2847,Stevie, And up until last night I was under the impression that you too only drank red wine. But I guess I was wrong?,,,0
2848,TRAIN_0_2848,David, I see where you're going with this. Um... I do drink red wine. But I also drink white wine.,,,0
2849,TRAIN_0_2849,Stevie, Oh. ,,,0
2850,TRAIN_0_2850,David," And I've been known to sample the occasional Rose. And a couple summers back I tried a Merlot, that used to be a chardonnay. ",,,0
2851,TRAIN_0_2851,Stevie, Uh-okay.,,,0
2852,TRAIN_0_2852,David, Which got a bit complicated.,,,0
2853,TRAIN_0_2853,Stevie," Yeah, so, you're just really open to all wines.",,,0
2854,TRAIN_0_2854,David," I like the wine, and not the label. Does that make sense? ",,,0
2855,TRAIN_0_2855,Stevie," Yes, that does. Okay. Um, this is just very new to me, so as long as you didn't roll over, and cry yourself to sleep with regret, then we're good, right? ",,,0
2856,TRAIN_0_2856,David," No, no, no, I absolutely did that. Just wept for hours in the dark. ",,,0
2857,TRAIN_1_2857,David," I say we go with this one, it's the biggest.",SARCASTIC, David did not cry for hours in the dark,1
2858,TRAIN_0_2858,David," Wow Ted, the place is very... New looking. Did you design the interior?",,,0
2859,TRAIN_0_2859,Ted," Oh, I wish! No, I found this website online that sells off old department store show rooms.",,,0
2860,TRAIN_0_2860,Stevie, So this whole room-,,,0
2861,TRAIN_0_2861,Ted," Just gets delivered, as is. This is the ""bachelor's den"" here, and then that's the ""executive dining lounge"" that I got on black Friday. ",,,0
2862,TRAIN_0_2862,David, Wow!,,,0
2863,TRAIN_0_2863,Ted, Yeah.,,,0
2864,TRAIN_0_2864,David, Wow.,,,0
2865,TRAIN_0_2865,Stevie, So... Are we the only ones showing up to this party?,,,0
2866,TRAIN_0_2866,Ted," No, we're still waiting for Mutt and Twyla.",,,0
2867,TRAIN_0_2867,Ted," Oh, I should take the rolls out of the microwave.",,,0
2868,TRAIN_0_2868,Hot rolls!,,,,0
2869,TRAIN_0_2869,David," Alexis had just said that this was a ""party"" party.",,,0
2870,TRAIN_0_2870,Alexis," Ah well, you must've been misinformed then, David. ",,,0
2871,TRAIN_0_2871,Ted," No, it's a dinner party. I wanted to get to know Alexis' friends a bit, so I figured we'd invite a few couples over, huh, have some dinner, play some games? ",,,0
2872,TRAIN_0_2872,Alexis, You guys showed!,,,0
2873,TRAIN_0_2873,Twyla," Yeah, why wouldn't we show?",,,0
2874,TRAIN_0_2874,Alexis," Twyla, I love your outfit, you look like a little Georgia peach!",,,0
2875,TRAIN_0_2875,David, Hi.,,,0
2876,TRAIN_0_2876,Mutt," So, where is everybody? I thought this was a party.",,,0

2883,TRAIN_0_2883,Jocelyn, Moira.,,,0
2884,TRAIN_0_2884,Roland," Ooh, Johnny! I gotta tell you, that suit, that's pretty dangerous to wear at a party like this!  I just wanna wipe my hands all over that! Oh! ",,,0
2885,TRAIN_0_2885,Johnny, You just keep getting funnier.,,,0
2886,TRAIN_0_2886,Roland," I'm not joking though, I really do. ",,,0
2887,TRAIN_0_2887,Jocelyn," Moira, I have to ask you, are those wigs real hair?  I just wanna reach out and just touch them",,,0

2889,TRAIN_0_2889,Jocelyn," Sorry, sorry. ",,,0
2890,TRAIN_0_2890,Roland," Hey Roses, if I tell you a secret, you promise to keep it? ",,,0
2891,TRAIN_0_2891,Johnny," Uh no, I don't think we would, what is it? ",,,0
2892,TRAIN_0_2892,Roland," Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Johnny... Now listen, I'm the guy in charge of upholding the law around here, so if you have any ideas about turning me in, you'd just be turning me in to myself! ",,,0
2893,TRAIN_0_2893,Jocelyn," Spark it up, Roley! Spark it up. ",,,0
2894,TRAIN_0_2894,Roland," You got it, honey. ",,,0
2895,TRAIN_0_2895,Jocelyn," Listen, I don't know if you guys wanna partake in this, because I'm sure your fancy dinner parties didn't have illegal substances! ",,,0
2896,TRAIN_0_2896,Moira," Illegal substances. Amateurs. We had friends in the fda, but... ",,,0
2897,TRAIN_0_2897,Johnny, When in Rome.,,,0
2898,TRAIN_0_2898,Roland," Well damn, Roses!",,,0

2902,TRAIN_0_2902,David,  No thank you.,,,0
2903,TRAIN_0_2903,Ted," So Mutt, did you two criminals do any good for the community today?",,,0
2904,TRAIN_0_2904,Mutt, We washed a car.,,,0
2905,TRAIN_0_2905,David," You washed a car, wow. The judicial system is really cracking down on its delinquents these days, huh? ",,,0
2906,TRAIN_0_2906,Ted," You know what I always wondered, what do you two talk about all day out there? ",SARCASTIC & RHETORICAL, David is making fun of Alexis for her community service and also making fun of the community service for being really easy,0
2907,TRAIN_0_2907,Alexis," Nothing. I mean we talk, but... We don't really talk about anything important.",,,0
2908,TRAIN_0_2908,Ted, So... Like what?,,,0
2909,TRAIN_0_2909,Alexis," Like, nothing! Okay, um... Like, Mutt was having a bad day today, so we talked about that.",,,0
2910,TRAIN_0_2910,Twyla, You didn't tell me you were having a bad day. ,,,0
2911,TRAIN_0_2911,Stevie," Ted, this is delicious.",,,0
2912,TRAIN_0_2912,David, Mm-hmm.,,,0

2914,TRAIN_0_2914,Ted," Thank you, Stevie, I ordered it online from Nevada. No sales tax.",,,0
2915,TRAIN_0_2915,Twyla, What were you questioning?,,,0
2916,TRAIN_0_2916,Mutt, It's nothing.,,,0
2917,TRAIN_0_2917,David," So when the lasagna gets delivered, does it come frozen, or... ?",,,0
2918,TRAIN_0_2918,Twyla," Okay, I just uh... I don't know why you didn't feel comfortable talking to me about it.",,,0
2919,TRAIN_0_2919,Mutt, It's not important. That's why I was talking to Alexis about it.,,,0
2920,TRAIN_0_2920,Ted," Stevie, how long have you and David been um...",,,0
2921,TRAIN_0_2921,Alexis," It's very fresh, and new.",,,0

2925,TRAIN_0_2925,Stevie, So everyone knows?,,,0
2926,TRAIN_0_2926,Twyla, Knows what?,,,0
2927,TRAIN_0_2927,Ted, These two have...,,,0
2928,TRAIN_0_2928,David," What an elegant gesture, Ted. ",,,0
2929,TRAIN_1_2929,Ted," I-I'm sorry, I thought everyone knew. ",SARCASTIC, Requires visual information. Ted made a crude hand gesture to indicate that David and Stevie had sex,1

2936,TRAIN_0_2936,Jocelyn," No, I'm not buying that!",,,0
2937,TRAIN_0_2937,Moira, It's true.,,,0
2938,TRAIN_0_2938,Jocelyn, Really? Why would you leave?,,,0
2939,TRAIN_0_2939,Moira," Oh God, I couldn't wait to get out. I was dying there. Have you never dreamed? Of a life beyond?",,,0
2940,TRAIN_0_2940,Jocelyn," You have what ifs, like, what if... I had enlisted in the military, what if Roland hadn't been such a smooth talker, what if? ",,,0

3082,TRAIN_0_3082,David,"Okay. Yeah. No, let's do that. Let's, uh, let's put up some boundaries uh, for the infrequent benefits that our friendship has. I think that's really good. Can we do that after you screw mister fix-it or... would you like to do it now? Let's throw some boundaries up.",,,0

3161,TRAIN_0_3161,David, Like one of those guys that has like a... Candy bowl of condoms on his bedside table or something. ,,,0
3162,TRAIN_0_3162,Stevie," Oh, hope so. Wonder what colour I'll get. ",,,0
3163,TRAIN_0_3163,David," Yeah! So I am mentoring a teen in crisis... later.  That's what I'm doing.  One of Jocelyn's students, so...  He's being bullied because he's different, so I'm helping to change his life. Giving back, so... ",,,0

3165,TRAIN_0_3165,David, Yeah. ,,,0
3166,TRAIN_0_3166,Stevie," And on a scale of one to ten, how much are you looking forward to that? ",,,0
3167,TRAIN_0_3167,David," Three point five. I'm gonna leave you be because it's not everyday you get to go on a date with a guy who owns a windowless van, so... Oh, Grant.",,,0

3175,TRAIN_0_3175,Connor, Yeah.,,,0
3176,TRAIN_0_3176,David," I don't know how much Mrs. Schitt has told you, but she asked me to come in and have a chat. She thinks that since we're both... new here it might be worth talking about some things like, you know, fitting in. Apparently you're having trouble fitting in.",,,0
3177,TRAIN_0_3177,Connor, Who... who... who are... who are you?,,,0
3178,TRAIN_0_3178,David," Oh, my name is David.",,,0
3179,TRAIN_0_3179,Connor, Are you... like a doctor or something? A psychologist?,,,0
3180,TRAIN_0_3180,David," Am I what? N-uh, no.",,,0
3181,TRAIN_0_3181,Connor, So why would I talk to you?,,,0
3182,TRAIN_0_3182,David, I don't know. Because your teacher is concerned that you're having trouble adjusting.,,,0
3183,TRAIN_0_3183,Connor," So she told you to come here and... and what, help... help me? Look at you. Look at your pants.",,,0
3184,TRAIN_0_3184,David, Excuse me! I am sensing a tinge of disrespect here.,,,0
3185,TRAIN_0_3185,Connor," I'll tell you what my problem is. I'm a 16-year-old gay kid living in a town that makes me wanna throw up. The issue isn't me not fitting in. It's me not wanting to fit in. Is there anything else you wanna, you wanna help me with?",,,0
3186,TRAIN_0_3186,David, No.,,,0
3187,TRAIN_0_3187,Moira, Go ahead and order whatever you want. This is on us.,,,0

3191,TRAIN_0_3191,Deedee," Nothing for me, thanks.",,,0
3192,TRAIN_0_3192,Johnny," Well, isn't that funny. Because Moira doesn't eat here either. But I will be eating and I just don't know whether to have the ribs or the chops, but I'm definitely ordering pork. ",,,0
3193,TRAIN_0_3193,Moira, If you mention pork one more time...,,,0
3194,TRAIN_0_3194,Johnny," Moira, um... don't you have something you wanna say to your sister?",,,0
3195,TRAIN_0_3195,Moira, No.,,,0
3196,TRAIN_0_3196,Johnny," Oh, I'm pretty sure you do.",,,0
3197,TRAIN_0_3197,Moira, I'm pretty sure I don't.,,,0
3198,TRAIN_0_3198,Deedee," Thank you for trying, Johnny. Truly. But like I'm just really uncomfortable right now with my older sister acting like a stubborn child. ",,,0
3199,TRAIN_0_3199,Johnny," Okay, why don't we all take a deep breath here and try and remember what's really important, okay? We are family, and we have to hang onto that. And you know as well as I do, Moira, that in times of crisis, the one thing we need to hang onto is family. ",,,0
3200,TRAIN_0_3200,Moira," Okay, okay.   Deedee... We appreciate you coming to this town... And offering whatever it is you're offering. Much appreciated. 'Cause seriously, I thought you were just coming here to gloat. ",,,0
3201,TRAIN_0_3201,Deedee," No, no, no. I came here in the spirit of giving and forgiving. The... the gloating thing was a bonus.",,,0
3202,TRAIN_0_3202,Johnny," Moira, go on...",,,0
3203,TRAIN_0_3203,Deedee," Yes, go on.",,,0
3204,TRAIN_0_3204,Moira, We need help. Please help us.,,,0
3205,TRAIN_0_3205,Deedee, Okay! I will. Hmm?,,,0
3206,TRAIN_0_3206,Johnny, Oh!,,,0
3207,TRAIN_0_3207,Deedee," I'm gonna do this for you, but mostly, I'm doing it for me. Why? Because you can't... And I can. Okay. How much are we gonna make this out for?",,,0
3208,TRAIN_0_3208,Johnny," Oh... sh... I haven't the foggiest. I couldn't...   I couldn't come up with a number. I mean, I... whatever you think is fair. ",,,0
3209,TRAIN_0_3209,Deedee," Well, you guys gave me fifty grand, right? ",,,0
3210,TRAIN_0_3210,Johnny," Yes, we gave you fifty thousand when we had the money.  But I can't... I can't ask you for fifty thousand dollars.  Whatever you think is the... Equivalent amount. ",,,0
3211,TRAIN_0_3211,Deedee,"  Okay, I think I can do you... A little better than that. Okay?  ",,,0
3212,TRAIN_0_3212,Johnny," Oh, so... unnecessary, Deedee, but thank you. Well, who's up for pork? ",,,0
3213,TRAIN_0_3213,Connor," Okay... so you're telling me your girlfriend is on a date with someone else and, instead of doing something about it, you're here talking to me, a kid who practically has no respect for you. ",,,0
3214,TRAIN_0_3214,David," Well, first of all, you're a little bitchy. Second of all, she is not my girlfriend. She's someone I'm occasionally having sex with because we're bored and desperate. ",,,0
3215,TRAIN_1_3215,Connor, Ah... you're doing a friends with benefits thing with this girl. Have you not seen the 42 films they've made about it? ,RHETORICAL, Connor is pointing out that there are many examples that the friend with benefits situation doesn’t work,1
3216,TRAIN_0_3216,Connor, It never works.,,,0
3217,TRAIN_0_3217,David," Okay, well, movies aren't always right, all right? You'll learn that later in life.  I happen to be a little bit older than you are, so... ",,,0
3218,TRAIN_0_3218,Connor, Obviously.,,,0
3219,TRAIN_0_3219,David," Okay. Well, I think we're good here.  You're gonna be okay, right? You're stable?",,,0
3220,TRAIN_0_3220,Connor, I have a party later. Can you buy me some beer? ,,,0
3221,TRAIN_1_3221,David," Uh, no. Can you buy me some beer?! ",RHETORICAL, David is making fun of Connor for asking if he could buy beer,1
3222,TRAIN_0_3222,Alexis, Hey! Can I grab a glass of water? ,,,0
3223,TRAIN_0_3223,Twyla," Yeah, sure.",,,0
3224,TRAIN_0_3224,Alexis, Thank you. So how's the uh... song going? Is that... Is the song still a thing?,,,0
3225,TRAIN_0_3225,Twyla, Yeah! Do you wanna hear some of it?,,,0
3226,TRAIN_0_3226,Alexis," Um, I would love to, but I actually hate music, so... I don't think I'd be a very good judge.",,,0
3227,TRAIN_0_3227,Twyla, You hate music?,,,0
3228,TRAIN_0_3228,Alexis, Mm-hmm... Are we sure that Mutt likes music? 'Cause I feel like if he didn't it could be kind of... awkward.,,,0
3229,TRAIN_0_3229,Twyla, Are you feeling okay?,,,0
3230,TRAIN_0_3230,Alexis," Um... I just don't think that... The song thing is a good idea. For, like, a lot of reasons. Um... are you sure that you wanna put yourself in such a vulnerable situation, Twy?",,,0
3231,TRAIN_0_3231,Twyla, Are you saying you don't think Mutt would like it?,,,0
3232,TRAIN_0_3232,Alexis," I don't know. I mean... I'm not sure. Maybe, but... I don't... I'm not... yeah, I'm not sure.",,,0
3233,TRAIN_0_3233,Twyla," Did you talk to Mutt? Because I know that... We've been sort of off for a while. And I've been just trying to think of things to make it better and so I'm... you know, I'm just trying to make it work. ",,,0
3234,TRAIN_0_3234,Alexis, I think that you should talk to Mutt before... Breaking into song. ,,,0
3235,TRAIN_0_3235,Twyla," Thank you, Alexis. ",,,0
3236,TRAIN_0_3236,Alexis, For what? Bye.,,,0
3237,TRAIN_0_3237,Twyla," In all honesty, Mutt was just a place holder. According to my tea leaves, the guy I'm suppose to marry is black, so...",,,0
3238,TRAIN_0_3238,David, Oh.,,,0
3239,TRAIN_0_3239,Stevie, What and why are we drinking?,,,0
3240,TRAIN_0_3240,David," Oh my goodness! Um, I don't know, and today, some snippy teen told me that my life was a mess, so... ",,,0
3241,TRAIN_0_3241,Twyla, And I am now a single person.,,,0
3242,TRAIN_0_3242,Stevie, Oh...,,,0
3243,TRAIN_0_3243,David, So did you spend the night washing your clothes on Grant's abs? ,SARCASTIC & RHETORICAL, David is teasing Stevie because she had a date with Grant,0
3244,TRAIN_0_3244,Stevie, You're funny.,,,0
3245,TRAIN_0_3245,David, Mm-hmm.,,,0
3246,TRAIN_0_3246,Stevie," Um, Grant went to the bathroom and never came back.",,,0
3247,TRAIN_0_3247,Stevie, Thank you.,,,0
3248,TRAIN_0_3248,David, What? He w... he went to the bathroom and never came back? ,,,0
3249,TRAIN_0_3249,Stevie, Mm-hmm.,,,0
3250,TRAIN_0_3250,David, Oh...,,,0
3251,TRAIN_0_3251,Stevie, So either I was stood up halfway through my date or Grant has some serious digestive issues. ,,,0
3252,TRAIN_0_3252,Twyla, Mm.,,,0
3253,TRAIN_0_3253,David, Wow. Sounds like a real catch.,,,0
3254,TRAIN_0_3254,Stevie, Mm-hmm...,,,0
3255,TRAIN_0_3255,David, Um...  So word on teen street is that our little... Friends with benefits situation is a-,,,0
3256,TRAIN_0_3256,Stevie, Not a good idea?,,,0
3257,TRAIN_0_3257,David," Is a bad idea. And because I don't have any other friends here, I can't afford to lose you, so... I think it's best if we just...",,,0
3258,TRAIN_0_3258,Stevie, Friends.,,,0
3259,TRAIN_0_3259,David, Friends. Yup. I think that's best. Good. This is good.,,,0
3260,TRAIN_0_3260,David," That's good, right?",,,0
3261,TRAIN_0_3261,Stevie, That's good.,,,0
3262,TRAIN_0_3262,David, Okay. Well... Warmest wishes to that.,,,0

3269,TRAIN_0_3269,Twyla," It's good, right? ",,,0
3270,TRAIN_0_3270,David, My eyes are tearing. ,,,0
3271,TRAIN_0_3271,Twyla,  ,,,0
3272,TRAIN_1_3272,Johnny, So this is it? ,RHETORICAL, Johnny is shocked by the low amount of the check from Deedee,1
3273,TRAIN_0_3273,Johnny," After all that? And we paid for the dinner! So we lost money on the whole deal. I'll tell ya, she's gonna be embarrassed when this thing gets cashed. She will be embarrassed. She missed a zero. Moira, she missed a zero or two. I... you know what? I'm gonna call her. I'm calling her right now, that... What a cheap-ass amount! ",,,0
3274,TRAIN_0_3274,Moira,"  Turn your light off, John.",,,0

3283,TRAIN_0_3283,Alexis, No... her birthday is the second weekend in May.,,,0
3284,TRAIN_0_3284,Johnny," That's mother's day, honey.",,,0
3285,TRAIN_0_3285,Alexis, I don't think so.,,,0
3286,TRAIN_0_3286,David, I just don't think that this is the year to be doing something big. ,,,0
3287,TRAIN_0_3287,Johnny," Oh, why? Because we're here, in this town? All the more reason to do something.",,,0
3288,TRAIN_0_3288,Alexis," Um... I actually agree with David. Um... plus, I'm gonna be in Chicago this weekend. ",,,0
3289,TRAIN_0_3289,Johnny, You're what? ,,,0

3294,TRAIN_0_3294,David,  No. That's not... That's not a good idea. ,,,0
3295,TRAIN_0_3295,Johnny, That's not a good idea?,,,0
3296,TRAIN_0_3296,David, Where would you even throw a party like that in this town? ,,,0
3297,TRAIN_0_3297,Johnny, I don't know. I haven't thought that through yet. Maybe Roland's house.,,,0
3298,TRAIN_0_3298,David, Listen to the words coming out of your mouth.,,,0
3299,TRAIN_0_3299,Johnny, Then you plan it.,,,0
3300,TRAIN_0_3300,David, What? No!,,,0
3301,TRAIN_0_3301,Alexis," Oh, snap, David!",,,0
3302,TRAIN_0_3302,Johnny," Talk to the hand, son, because the ears are no longer working. ",,,0
3303,TRAIN_0_3303,David, Oh my God.,,,0
3304,TRAIN_0_3304,Alexis," 'Kay, that's not at all how that works, so...",,,0
3305,TRAIN_0_3305,Johnny," Cancel your trip, Alexis, because the travel agent is out of the office. ",,,0
3306,TRAIN_0_3306,Alexis, It's so uncomfortable when he does stuff like that.,,,0
3307,TRAIN_0_3307,David, No. Absolutely not.,,,0
3308,TRAIN_0_3308,Alexis, I feel so weird about it. ,,,0

3310,TRAIN_0_3310,Alexis," Oh my God. Well, that's probably gonna have to change, but what else did you book for us?",,,0

3312,TRAIN_0_3312,Alexis, Oh my God.,,,0
3313,TRAIN_0_3313,Ted, Got upgraded.,,,0
3314,TRAIN_0_3314,Alexis, Does that mean room service?!,,,0
3315,TRAIN_0_3315,Ted, Yeah.,,,0
3316,TRAIN_0_3316,Alexis, Babe! ,,,0
3317,TRAIN_0_3317,David, Hi!,,,0
3318,TRAIN_0_3318,Alexis, Hey.,,,0
3319,TRAIN_0_3319,David, Had an idea for mom's stupid surprise party thing.,,,0
3320,TRAIN_0_3320,Alexis," Oh, yeah, yeah.",,,0
3321,TRAIN_0_3321,David," What if we told her that it was a fund-raiser? She'd have to say yes, right?",,,0
3322,TRAIN_0_3322,Alexis," Yeah, yeah, yeah.",,,0
3323,TRAIN_0_3323,David," 'Cause she'd have to come then, right?",,,0

3329,TRAIN_0_3329,Alexis," David, I told you that I couldn't come... ",,,0
3330,TRAIN_0_3330,Ted, It's this Saturday? ,,,0
3331,TRAIN_0_3331,Alexis," To that.  Yeah. But, David, I did tell you that I...  Won't be able to attend, so... ",,,0
3332,TRAIN_0_3332,Ted," Well, Lex, I mean... You can't miss your own mother's surprise party. ",,,0
3333,TRAIN_0_3333,David, I am with... I'm with Ted on this one. ,,,0
3334,TRAIN_0_3334,Alexis," But, babe, you're going to... A veterinary conference in a Chicago suburb and I think that's... that's really important for us. ",,,0
3335,TRAIN_0_3335,David," Yeah, I know. Here's just the thing about our mom"," She'll be really devastated if Alexis doesn't come, and I'm sure you're from a really solid home and... ",,0
3336,TRAIN_0_3336,Alexis, David...,,,0
3337,TRAIN_0_3337,David, Understand.,,,0
3338,TRAIN_0_3338,Alexis,"  I'm gonna slap you in the face. Um... but babe, what about the um... The travelling pizza tour that was so... ",,,0
3339,TRAIN_1_3339,David," yeah, and I'm also gonna need you to ask Mutt for the barn 'cause I'm thinking of heading in that sort of aesthetic direction for the party. Um, and I know that you guys have a close working relationship, so... ",SARCASTIC, David is making fun of Alexis because she is flirty with Mutt and does community service with Mutt,1
3340,TRAIN_0_3340,Alexis, No. No. ,,,0

3342,TRAIN_0_3342,David, Me too.,,,0
3343,TRAIN_0_3343,Alexis," David, you and mom literally ruin my life.",,,0
3344,TRAIN_0_3344,Johnny, Roland!,,,0
3345,TRAIN_0_3345,Roland, Hey! Johnny Rose! How are you?,,,0
3346,TRAIN_0_3346,Johnny, I'm good!,,,0
3347,TRAIN_0_3347,Roland, Good.,,,0
3348,TRAIN_0_3348,Johnny, Listen. Need a big favour.,,,0
3349,TRAIN_0_3349,Roland, Sure.,,,0
3350,TRAIN_0_3350,Johnny, Saturday is Moira's birthday and we want to throw her a surprise party. ,,,0
3351,TRAIN_0_3351,Roland, Oh!,,,0
3352,TRAIN_0_3352,Johnny," So, we need an excuse to get her all dressed up and out of the house.",,,0
3353,TRAIN_0_3353,Roland," Well, dinner at our place. Problem solved.",,,0
3354,TRAIN_0_3354,Johnny," Well... tempting, but it's gotta be something fancy and, uh, elegant. You know, black tie. So we're thinking maybe Jocelyn is throwing her ""annual charity fundraiser.""",,,0
3355,TRAIN_0_3355,Roland, She hasn't mentioned anything to me about it.,,,0
3356,TRAIN_0_3356,Johnny, Why would she mention it? ,,,0
3357,TRAIN_0_3357,Roland,"  Well, Johnny, uh... If she's planning a fundraiser, I think Jocelyn would mention something about it to her husband. ",,,0
3358,TRAIN_0_3358,Johnny," It's not a real fundraiser, Roland. It's just a pretend fundraiser to get Moira out of the house. You see, I-I could tell her about it myself, but she would catch on because it falls on the same night as her birthday, so she's gotta hear about the fundraiser from someone who doesn't know it's her birthday. ",,,0
3359,TRAIN_0_3359,Roland," Okay, so then you want me to find somebody who doesn't know. ",,,0
3360,TRAIN_0_3360,Johnny, No. I want you to tell her.,,,0
3361,TRAIN_0_3361,Roland, But that doesn't make any sense. I know it's her birthday. ,,,0
3362,TRAIN_0_3362,Johnny, You only know it's her birthday because I just told you it's her birthday. Moira doesn't know you know it's her birthday.,,,0
3363,TRAIN_0_3363,Roland, I won't tell her.,,,0
3364,TRAIN_0_3364,Johnny, Why would you tell her? ,,,0
3365,TRAIN_0_3365,Roland," I won't tell her is what I'm saying to you. I won't tell her, so don't worry about it.",,,0
3366,TRAIN_0_3366,Johnny," Okay, but now I am worried. I am worried... now. Look, I'm taking Moira out for coffees. We're going up to the cafe?, okay, this afternoon.",,,0
3367,TRAIN_0_3367,Roland, Uh-huh.,,,0
3368,TRAIN_0_3368,Johnny, And that would be a great time for you to stop by and drop the information about the fundraiser. Tell me you understand the plan. ,,,0
3369,TRAIN_0_3369,Roland," Yes, Johnny, I understand the plan! Jeez! And I don't appreciate being talked to like a child!",,,0
3370,TRAIN_0_3370,Johnny," Okay, I'm sorry. Roland-",,,0
3371,TRAIN_0_3371,Roland," Well, I'm sorry. It's a little demeaning.",,,0
3372,TRAIN_0_3372,Johnny," Look, I'm sorry. It's just so important. This is really important. I wanna make sure you understand the plan.",,,0
3373,TRAIN_0_3373,Roland," Okay! I understand, all right?",,,0
3374,TRAIN_0_3374,Johnny, Okay.,,,0
3375,TRAIN_0_3375,Roland, I just think it's awfully short notice to start planning a fundraiser. ,,,0
3376,TRAIN_0_3376,Johnny,  There is no fundraiser!,,,0
3377,TRAIN_0_3377,Roland, Right. No fundraiser.,,,0
3378,TRAIN_0_3378,Johnny, It's pretend!,,,0
3379,TRAIN_0_3379,Roland, Pretend. It's fun time.,,,0
3380,TRAIN_0_3380,David, So I... am gonna need a lift to Elmdale.,,,0
3381,TRAIN_1_3381,Stevie, What does it look like I'm doing? ,RHETORICAL, Stevie is working,1
3382,TRAIN_0_3382,David," I don't know, nothing?",,,0
3383,TRAIN_0_3383,Stevie, I'm working.,,,0
3384,TRAIN_0_3384,David," Oh, you are?",,,0
3385,TRAIN_0_3385,Stevie, Yes. I have a job that I just can't leave to drive you to Elmdale. ,,,0
3386,TRAIN_0_3386,David," Okay... yeah, and I totally respect that.  It's just that I found a Ganache Torte in Elmdale and I really need to pick it up before my mom's birthday thing, so... ",,,0
3387,TRAIN_0_3387,Stevie, I work until six.,,,0
3388,TRAIN_0_3388,David," Okay, but like is anyone checking in this afternoon?",,,0
3389,TRAIN_0_3389,Stevie, It's a cake. ,,,0
3390,TRAIN_0_3390,David, It's a torte! Um... is there something going on?,,,0
3391,TRAIN_0_3391,Stevie, You could always just hitch-hike?,,,0
3392,TRAIN_1_3392,David, And wake up chained to a pole in a trucker's basement?  ,RHETORICAL, David is implying it is not safe to hitch-hike,1
3393,TRAIN_0_3393,David, Not today.,,,0
3394,TRAIN_0_3394,Stevie," Well, I'm working... At my job, so I can't just up and leave because you want cake. ",,,0
3395,TRAIN_1_3395,David," Okay. Well, when you put it like that, it makes me sound ridiculous... Um... which I'm not. So... thank you...  For your services this afternoon. ",SARCASTIC, David is being rude because Stevie would not help him,1
3396,TRAIN_0_3396,Roland," Hey! Hey... sorry I'm late, Johnny. Had a little memorizing... To do.",,,0
3397,TRAIN_0_3397,Johnny," Late for... late for what, Roland? I don't know what you mean?",,,0
3398,TRAIN_0_3398,Roland," For Jocelyn's big shindig. I'm here to personally invite the two of you to, um, a um... annual, um, elegant dress-up event that Jocelyn is hosting. Um... well, no, I'm not inviting you, but I'm saying we're... We'll see each other there... At the very big event that Jocelyn is hosting. The whole town will go to this event.  They'll all be dressed up and um... Did I did I say that it's a fundraiser? Oh, sorry, Johnny. Let me start over here.",,,0
3399,TRAIN_0_3399,Johnny, Why are you apologizing to me? You don't have to apologize to me.,,,0
3400,TRAIN_0_3400,Roland," No, no. It's a fundraiser for the thing with the... Children that... The-with the mouth... Uh, cleft palates, and um... Joc' does it every year- ",,,0
3401,TRAIN_0_3401,Johnny," well, uh, Roland, you know what? We're-we're... Probably just gonna be hanging around the... motel on Saturday, you know.",,,0
3402,TRAIN_0_3402,Roland," Yeah, no, I'm sure. It's uh... Hard to look at those kids and all that, I get it. But you know what? We'll dress them up too.",,,0
3403,TRAIN_0_3403,Moira, Put us down for four tickets.,,,0
3404,TRAIN_0_3404,Johnny, Really?,,,0
3405,TRAIN_0_3405,Moira," Oh yes, it's the least we can do to support Jocelyn's philanthropic endeavours.",,,0
3406,TRAIN_0_3406,Johnny, Oh! Okay.,,,0
3407,TRAIN_0_3407,Roland," Well, I'm sure Jocelyn would really appreciate it.",,,0
3408,TRAIN_0_3408,Johnny," Well, listen, thank you, Roland, for that.",,,0
3409,TRAIN_0_3409,Roland, You're welcome. I think that went well! ,,,0
3410,TRAIN_0_3410,Johnny," Okay, thank you. ",,,0
3411,TRAIN_0_3411,Roland," Okay. So I guess I'll see you soon then, Johnny. ",,,0
3412,TRAIN_0_3412,Johnny, Yeah... bye-bye. ,,,0
3413,TRAIN_0_3413,Roland," Yes, goodbye, Johnny. ",,,0
3414,TRAIN_0_3414,Alexis," Oh, sorry! ",,,0
3415,TRAIN_1_3415,Alexis, Ugh! Could you be going any faster? ,RHETORICAL, Alexis is annoyed by the driver who is going too fast,1
3416,TRAIN_0_3416,Mutt," Well, we should put that up quick. ",,,0
3417,TRAIN_1_3417,Alexis," Um... so we're planning this surprise for my mom that's totally not gonna work and I'm supposed to ask you if we can borrow your barn. But if you can't take the night off from bedding women, I totally... understand. ",SARCASTIC, Alexis is saying that Mutt is always sleeping around,1
3418,TRAIN_1_3418,Mutt," Well, who says I can't do both? ",RHETORICAL, Mutt is joking and being flirtatious,1
3419,TRAIN_0_3419,Mutt, You had a bug in your hair. ,,,0
3420,TRAIN_0_3420,Alexis, Oh.  Ew!,,,0
3421,TRAIN_0_3421,Moira, Jocelyn!,,,0
3422,TRAIN_0_3422,Jocelyn," Moira, hi!",,,0
3423,TRAIN_0_3423,Moira," Jocelyn, I'm so glad I've run into you. Roland was mentioning your fundraiser earlier today and it got me thinking... ",,,0
3424,TRAIN_0_3424,Jocelyn, My what? ,,,0
3425,TRAIN_0_3425,Moira, Your annual fundraiser for the children with troubled mouths. ,,,0
3426,TRAIN_0_3426,Jocelyn," Oh, right. Yes. It's gonna be q-quite a night. ",,,0
3427,TRAIN_0_3427,Moira," I hope so, 'cause I'd like to be involved. ",,,0
3428,TRAIN_0_3428,Jocelyn, With...? ,,,0
3429,TRAIN_0_3429,Moira," Your fundraiser. As I'm sure you know, I was on the board of some of the most profitable not-profits, from San Francisco to London. And after speaking with Roland, I realized I was remiss not to gift you with my wealth of experience. ",,,0
3430,TRAIN_0_3430,Jocelyn," Wow! That's very generous of you, Moira. I was gonna ask you, but I didn't wanna impose. ",,,0
3431,TRAIN_0_3431,Moira," Jocelyn, you must stop being intimidated by me. It's unnerving. ",,,0
3432,TRAIN_0_3432,Jocelyn, Sorry. ,,,0
3433,TRAIN_0_3433,Moira," No, it's fine. Just say thank you. ",,,0
3434,TRAIN_0_3434,Jocelyn, Thank you? ,,,0
3435,TRAIN_0_3435,Moira, There you go! My pleasure! ,,,0
3436,TRAIN_0_3436,Jocelyn," Oh, fuck! ",,,0
3437,TRAIN_0_3437,Johnny," What do you mean, you didn't get the cake? ",,,0
3438,TRAIN_0_3438,David," The only Chocolate Ganache cake I could find, was in Elmdale, and I asked Stevie to drive me but she said no because I think she's going through something right now. ",,,0
3439,TRAIN_0_3439,Moira, David!,,,0
3440,TRAIN_0_3440,David, I don't know. Something with her body. ,,,0
3441,TRAIN_0_3441,Moira," David, I need you. I was speaking to Jocelyn about this fundraiser she's apparently organizing-",,,0
3442,TRAIN_0_3442,Johnny," Whoa-whoa, you-you were talking to Jocelyn?",,,0
3443,TRAIN_0_3443,Moira," Yes, about the fundraiser, and the poor thing looked like a deer caught in the headlights. And I cannot stand by and watch this woman drive a perfectly worthy cause into the ground. So, David, you and I... We're gonna help her.",,,0
3444,TRAIN_0_3444,David," Okay. I asked you to get her invited to the fundraiser, not involved in the fundraiser.",,,0
3445,TRAIN_1_3445,Johnny, The fundraiser was your idea! You didn't think your mother would get involved in planning a fundraiser? ,RHETORICAL, Johnny is pointing out that Moira loves a fundraiser and would want to be involved,1
3446,TRAIN_0_3446,Johnny," My God, she had Hilary shaking last year at the Clinton foundation dinner. God! Roland. Roland. Stupid Roland.",,,0
3447,TRAIN_0_3447,David, Roland?! How did Roland get involved in this?,,,0
3448,TRAIN_0_3448,Johnny," I got him involved, it was a bad mistake, okay? But look, it'll be fine. I will get the cake with your sister. All you've gotta do is keep your mother under control.",,,0
3449,TRAIN_1_3449,David, The North Korean army could not keep my mother under control when it comes to event planning. ,SARCASTIC, David is saying that Moira gets carried away with event planning,1
3450,TRAIN_0_3450,Johnny, What? Huh? Oh! How long was I sleeping? ,,,0
3451,TRAIN_0_3451,Alexis," I dunno, like forty-five maybe. ",,,0
3452,TRAIN_0_3452,Johnny, Oh? Where are we? ,,,0
3453,TRAIN_0_3453,Alexis," Um, we're almost there. The last sign I saw said ""exit Elmdale,"" so... I haven't seen it yet, but... We should be getting there soon. ",,,0
3454,TRAIN_0_3454,Johnny," The last sign said ""exit Elmdale?"" ",,,0
3455,TRAIN_0_3455,Alexis, Mm-hmm. ,,,0
3456,TRAIN_0_3456,Johnny," Well, that was the exit to Elmdale. We've gone too far, we've gotta turn back! ",,,0
3457,TRAIN_0_3457,Alexis, But you were sleeping! ,,,0
3458,TRAIN_0_3458,Johnny," Well, wake me up! ",,,0
3459,TRAIN_0_3459,Alexis, No! Because you're so grumpy when you wake- like you're grumpy right now. ,,,0
3460,TRAIN_0_3460,Johnny, Oh?! ,,,0
3461,TRAIN_0_3461,Alexis, Oh!  ,,,0
3462,TRAIN_1_3462,Jocelyn," Well, Moira, in regards to the decorations, David was kind enough to offer me an incredibly long list of the things to stay away from. ",SARCASTIC, Jocelyn did not think it was kind of David,1
3463,TRAIN_0_3463,Moira," Darling, one does not just stick a red nose on it and call it an event. There is an order to these things.",,,0
3464,TRAIN_0_3464,Ronnie," Okay, here we go. ",,,0
3465,TRAIN_0_3465,Moira," Again, what is the organization that it's for? ",,,0
3466,TRAIN_0_3466,Jocelyn, The surgeons...,,,0
3467,TRAIN_0_3467,David, Uh...the doctors who un-cleft the mouths.,,,0
3468,TRAIN_0_3468,Moira, Never heard of it. ,,,0
3469,TRAIN_0_3469,Moira, And who are the trustees?,,,0
3470,TRAIN_0_3470,David, I don't think they're gonna come.,,,0
3471,TRAIN_0_3471,Moira," Oh, how very churlish of them. How much are tickets?",,,0
3472,TRAIN_0_3472,Jocelyn, Um... free?,,,0
3473,TRAIN_0_3473,David, We haven't figured out the ticket price yet.,,,0
3474,TRAIN_0_3474,Ronnie, I'm not paying for this thing.,,,0
3475,TRAIN_1_3475,Moira, Oh my God! Do you people know what the word fundraising means? ,RHETORICAL, Moira is implying that the fundraising team has no idea what they are doing,1
3476,TRAIN_0_3476,Ronnie, Why don't you leave that up to us.,,,0
3477,TRAIN_0_3477,Moira," Jocelyn, I need your timeline and your checklist. Your plan book.",,,0
3478,TRAIN_0_3478,Jocelyn," Well, we have a plan. It's just we haven't... You know, we're just, we're still working-",,,0
3479,TRAIN_0_3479,David," Listen, Jocelyn is doing the best that she can... Considering what little Jocelyn has to work with.",,,0
3480,TRAIN_0_3480,Moira," David, personal comments are in bad taste. Okay, I'm trying to make sense of these flowers.",,,0
3481,TRAIN_0_3481,David, What is wrong with the flowers? They're seasonal and they... Tie in all of the other design elements that Jocelyn has come up with. ,,,0
3482,TRAIN_0_3482,Moira," David, I'm sorry, but it's coup d'e?tat time. If we don't force Jocelyn to step down this moment, I don't know how we're gonna pull of this nightmare. ",,,0
3483,TRAIN_0_3483,Ronnie, Why don't you just sit this one out then?,,,0
3484,TRAIN_1_3484,Moira, And you are? ,RHETORICAL, Moira is telling Ronnie to butt out of the conversation So... David? ,1
3485,TRAIN_1_3485,Moira,  I see. Clearly you don't need the help of the most prominent philanthropist in the country. No. Fine. I wish you all the best. ,SARCASTIC," Moira does not want to leave, she hopes that they ask her to stay, and if not that they have a terrible party",1
3486,TRAIN_0_3486,Moira," No, seriously, I might leave. Okay, last warning. In three... two... Oh my God. ",,,0
3487,TRAIN_0_3487,Jocelyn," Well, I think she is gonna be really surprised... don't you?",,,0
3488,TRAIN_0_3488,David, ,,,0
3489,TRAIN_0_3489,Moira," Oh, David, I don't know how you don't go mad with those people.",,,0
3490,TRAIN_1_3490,David," Well, those people are... Putting a lot of energy into raising money for those kids. ",SARCASTIC, David knows it is a surprise party and not a fundraiser,1
3491,TRAIN_0_3491,Moira, Jump ship. Save yourself.,,,0
3492,TRAIN_1_3492,David," Okay, I'm gonna ask you to put some pieces together here for me. We are throwing a ""fundraiser"" that just so happens to be on the same night as your birthday.  ",SARCASTIC, David is trying to hint to Moira that it is a surprise party,1
3493,TRAIN_0_3493,Moira, Must you rub it in?,,,0
3494,TRAIN_1_3494,David," We're throwing a ""fundraiser"" on your birthday. ",SARCASTIC, David is hinting that it is a surprise party,1
3495,TRAIN_0_3495,Moira, Now you're just being cruel.,,,0
3496,TRAIN_0_3496,David, The fundraiser isn't real. It's not a real thing.,,,0
3497,TRAIN_0_3497,Moira, Oh... you're planning a birthday thing...,,,0
3498,TRAIN_0_3498,David, Mm-hmm.,,,0
3499,TRAIN_0_3499,Moira, That I'm not supposed to know about.,,,0
3500,TRAIN_0_3500,David, Mm-mm.,,,0
3501,TRAIN_0_3501,Moira, In a barn?,,,0
3502,TRAIN_0_3502,Johnny, We can't afford the candles. They're $2.49.,,,0
3503,TRAIN_0_3503,Alexis, They don't just come with the cake?,,,0
3504,TRAIN_0_3504,Johnny," No, apparently not.",,,0
3505,TRAIN_0_3505,Alexis, Like matches when you buy cigarettes?,,,0
3506,TRAIN_0_3506,Johnny, You smoke? ,,,0
3507,TRAIN_0_3507,Alexis, Um... no. Can't we just ask them to give them to us?,,,0
3508,TRAIN_0_3508,Johnny," This is not some co-op commune, Alexis. You know, if there's a price tag on it, you gotta pay for it.",,,0
3509,TRAIN_0_3509,Alexis, Not if you just... take them.,,,0
3510,TRAIN_0_3510,Johnny," Well, that would be low bottom behavior, wouldn't it?",,,0
3511,TRAIN_0_3511,Alexis," Okay, well, how do you think I got these glasses from the gas station? ",,,0
3512,TRAIN_0_3512,Johnny, You stole sunglasses?!,,,0
3513,TRAIN_0_3513,Alexis, Yeah! It's a gas station.,,,0
3514,TRAIN_0_3514,Johnny," Oh my God, I raised a thief. Go wait in the car! Wait in the car while I pay for this.",,,0
3515,TRAIN_0_3515,Alexis, Ugh!,,,0
3516,TRAIN_0_3516,Bakery Clerk, Hi.,,,0
3517,TRAIN_0_3517,Johnny, Hi. Johnny Rose. I ordered a birthday cake.,,,0
3518,TRAIN_0_3518,Bakery Clerk," Yeah, Chocolate Ganache?",,,0
3519,TRAIN_0_3519,Johnny," That's right. Boy, it smells uh... So delicious in here.",,,0
3520,TRAIN_0_3520,Alexis,  Whoa! Thank you. ,,,0
3521,TRAIN_0_3521,Johnny," There we go, my dear.",,,0
3522,TRAIN_0_3522,Moira," Wait, wait, wait. One last check. Gorgeous. Perfection.  Like your father the day I married him. Look at us, the Roses, attending this town's most illustrious fundraising gala. ",,,0
3523,TRAIN_0_3523,David,  I think you're overselling it just a bit. ,,,0
3524,TRAIN_0_3524,Johnny," Well, I don't see any stragglers, so shall we go in? I think we're fashionably late enough.",,,0
3525,TRAIN_0_3525,Alexis," There's nothing fashionable about this, but- ",,,0
3526,TRAIN_0_3526,Johnny," after you, my dear. ",,,0
3527,TRAIN_0_3527,Moira, Where are all the patrons?,,,0
3528,TRAIN_0_3528,Johnny," Well, I don't know. Do we have the wrong night?",,,0
3529,TRAIN_0_3529,Everyone, Surprise!,,,0
3530,TRAIN_1_3530,Moira,  What?! There's no fundraiser?! You're just here to celebrate me? ,RHETORICAL, Moira knows it is a surprise party at this point and is pretending to be shocked,1
3531,TRAIN_0_3531,Moira," Oh, never in the history of surprises has one been so delightfully blindsided. ",,,0
3532,TRAIN_0_3532,Moira, Darling...,,,0
3533,TRAIN_0_3533,Jocelyn, Oh...,,,0
3534,TRAIN_0_3534,Johnny," Okay, who told her?",,,0

3542,TRAIN_1_3542,Stevie, Your mom sure seemed surprised. ,SARCASTIC, Moira was not surprised. She faked it poorly,1
3543,TRAIN_1_3543,David," Yeah, my mom was... Very surprised. ",SARCASTIC, Moira was not surprised. She faked it poorly,1
3544,TRAIN_0_3544,Stevie, And you got your cake.,,,0

3546,TRAIN_0_3546,Stevie," Yeah, so... I need to apologize for my behavior earlier. Mm-hmm. I think it's just that this whole- ",,,0
3547,TRAIN_0_3547,David," It's that lady time, huh?",,,0
3548,TRAIN_0_3548,Stevie, Friend thing...,,,0
3549,TRAIN_0_3549,David, Oh.,,,0
3550,TRAIN_0_3550,Stevie," Is proving to be a bit tricky and I think that in building that barrier up, I may have... built it a little high. ",,,0
3551,TRAIN_0_3551,David," Okay. Um... well, if the barrier's come down, can two friends dance? Is that okay? ",,,0
3552,TRAIN_0_3552,Stevie," Uh... I normally only slow dance with strangers, at bars... ",,,0
3553,TRAIN_0_3553,David, Right. ,,,0
3554,TRAIN_0_3554,Stevie, After I've had a few... ,,,0
3555,TRAIN_0_3555,David, Uh-huh. ,,,0

3562,TRAIN_0_3562,Alexis, Hey! Um... you look really... Amazing.,,,0
3563,TRAIN_0_3563,Mutt," Well, I didn't wanna be the only one not wearing a suit.",,,0
3564,TRAIN_0_3564,Alexis," Um, did you have to kill a man to get it, or...?",,,0
3565,TRAIN_1_3565,Mutt, I did. ,SARCASTIC, He did not kill a man,1
3566,TRAIN_1_3566,Mutt, It took me a couple to find one in my size. ,SARCASTIC, He did not kill anyone ,1
3567,TRAIN_0_3567,Mutt, But um... you clean up well.,,,0
3568,TRAIN_0_3568,Alexis," Ugh! Barely. I wore this thing to prom like a thousand years ago, but... it did bring me some luck that night, so I wore it here tonight. ",,,0
3569,TRAIN_0_3569,Mutt, You were planning on getting lucky tonight? So um... where is Ted?  ,,,0
3570,TRAIN_0_3570,Alexis," Um... he is at um... Like a... a conference or something tonight, so... ",,,0

3594,TRAIN_0_3594,Johnny, Told you I'd sell this town. Didn't I tell you?,,,0
3595,TRAIN_0_3595,David," Yes. Not to diminish your accomplishment, but you did say that a handful of times. I think eight, to be exact.",,,0
3596,TRAIN_0_3596,Johnny, It bears repeating.,,,0
3597,TRAIN_0_3597,Alexis, My little suity-cases! Oh!,,,0
3598,TRAIN_0_3598,Moira, David? Should I take this with me?,,,0
3599,TRAIN_0_3599,David," If I'm being perfectly honest, it's very low on the totem pole of coats of yours that I like, but- ",,,0
3600,TRAIN_0_3600,Moira, It was a gift from your father.,,,0
3601,TRAIN_0_3601,Johnny," Hey, that's a good coat. I outbid Richard Branson for it at the Kiminski auction.",,,0
3602,TRAIN_0_3602,Moira, I did get sick of having hot coffee and blood thrown at me. You know who covets this coat? Jocelyn. I could bestow it upon her as a parting gift.,,,0
3603,TRAIN_0_3603,Johnny," We may want to put pen to paper before we start giving away designer clothing, sweetheart. ",,,0
3604,TRAIN_0_3604,Moira, It would be her first piece of clothing made outside of mainland China. I'm gonna do it. ,,,0

3611,TRAIN_0_3611,Alexis, Oh! What people?,,,0
3612,TRAIN_0_3612,David, You don't know them. Just people.,,,0
3613,TRAIN_0_3613,Alexis, I thought everyone just kind of dropped you like flies when you couldn't pick up the tab at the Waverly anymore? ,,,0
3614,TRAIN_0_3614,David," Well, that's absolutely not true.  I just have a different kind of relationship with my friends where we don't need to be in constant contact with each other.",,,0
3615,TRAIN_0_3615,Alexis, Okay.,,,0
3616,TRAIN_0_3616,David, You should um... come to New York after you're done.,,,0

3618,TRAIN_0_3618,David," Well, I was thinking maybe we could get a... A two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan and not have to live in Brooklyn. ",,,0
3619,TRAIN_0_3619,Alexis," Honestly, David, and like no offense, but when I get out of here, I'm gonna get my own place so I can pack how I wanna pack and I don't have to be called a circus freak all the time. ",,,0
3620,TRAIN_0_3620,Moira, Ding-dong.,,,0
3621,TRAIN_0_3621,Jocelyn," Moira, hey!",,,0

3625,TRAIN_0_3625,Jocelyn, Yeah.  ,,,0
3626,TRAIN_0_3626,Moira, So I guess you heard the news.,,,0
3627,TRAIN_0_3627,Jocelyn, I heard there was someone interested in buying...,,,0
3628,TRAIN_0_3628,Moira," Yes, we're leaving.",,,0
3629,TRAIN_0_3629,Jocelyn, I didn't know it was finalized.,,,0
3630,TRAIN_0_3630,Moira, And since we're leaving... dear God it feels good to be saying that! I would like to give you this as a little keepsake to remember me by.,,,0
3631,TRAIN_0_3631,Jocelyn, Wow. Is-is it a wig?,,,0

3633,TRAIN_0_3633,Jocelyn, What coat?,,,0
3634,TRAIN_0_3634,Moira, The coat you kept going on about that one time.,,,0
3635,TRAIN_0_3635,Jocelyn, Are you sure it was me?,,,0
3636,TRAIN_0_3636,Moira," Oh, it's absolutely tragic, Jocelyn, that I will never see or speak to you ever again.",,,0
3637,TRAIN_0_3637,Jocelyn, Well...,,,0
3638,TRAIN_0_3638,Moira," But I will have my memories and you will have this incredible coat. Goodbye, dear friend.",,,0
3639,TRAIN_0_3639,Jocelyn," Goodbye, Moira Rose.",,,0
3640,TRAIN_0_3640,Ted, Hey! What're you doing here?,,,0
3641,TRAIN_0_3641,Alexis," Um, can I... ?",,,0
3642,TRAIN_0_3642,Ted," Yeah, yeah, come on in.",,,0

3653,TRAIN_0_3653,Alexis, Okay.,,,0
3654,TRAIN_0_3654,Ted,"  Uh... Originally, we were gonna be on an all-inclusive vacation when I did this... ",,,0
3655,TRAIN_0_3655,Alexis, What's an all-inclusive vacation?,,,0
3656,TRAIN_0_3656,Ted, Alexis Claire Rose... Will you marry me?,,,0
3657,TRAIN_0_3657,Alexis,"  Uh... uh... Yes! If I was staying, then yes! A thousand times, yes! And if things were different and I wasn't leaving, um, then definitely yes! ",,,0
3658,TRAIN_0_3658,Ted, So... is that a no? ,,,0
3659,TRAIN_0_3659,Alexis, Yes... ?,,,0
3660,TRAIN_0_3660,Stevie, Are you stealing Roland's truck?,,,0
3661,TRAIN_1_3661,David," Yeah. It's not exactly a Tesla, but it'll get our bags to the airport. ",SARCASTIC, David is making fun of Roland’s truck for not being very nice,1
3662,TRAIN_0_3662,Stevie, So you wanted to see me?,,,0
3663,TRAIN_0_3663,David, Yeah. I had an idea.,,,0
3664,TRAIN_0_3664,Stevie, Oh-oh.,,,0
3665,TRAIN_0_3665,David, What if you came with me to New York?,,,0

3672,TRAIN_0_3672,Stevie, I don't even know what I would do there.,,,0
3673,TRAIN_0_3673,David," Oh, you just watch a season of ""Girls"" and do the opposite of what they do. It's easy. ",,,0
3674,TRAIN_0_3674,Stevie," You have this like whole life there, with all these fancy friends... Who, in my head, at least all dress like you, and I feel like I'd get lost in the mix. ",,,0
3675,TRAIN_0_3675,David," Mm-hmm. Well, all of my friends will probably be away for the summer and I have found a really beautiful two-bedroom in the East Village. It's beautiful, so...",,,0
3676,TRAIN_0_3676,Stevie," Oh, two bedroom.",,,0
3677,TRAIN_0_3677,David," Yeah. I mean, I was looking at three bedrooms, but do I really need an office? I don't... I don't know. ",,,0
3678,TRAIN_0_3678,Stevie, Yeah... right.,,,0

3685,TRAIN_0_3685,Johnny, Oh. I'll have a coffee when you get a minute. ,,,0
3686,TRAIN_0_3686,Roland," Johnny, I gotta talk to you.  Listen, uh... I don't wanna piss in your punch bowl, okay, but um... I got a bad feeling about this buyer guy of yours, Andy... ",,,0

3688,TRAIN_0_3688,Roland, Roberts.,,,0
3689,TRAIN_0_3689,Johnny, Very successful. His family made a fortune in the shelving business.,,,0
3690,TRAIN_0_3690,Roland," Okay, fine. Um... He called me while he was bumping uglies with this old lady.",,,0
3691,TRAIN_0_3691,Johnny," Oh no, really?",,,0
3692,TRAIN_1_3692,Roland," But that's not the problem. The problem is he put me on the speaker phone. I mean, who would do such a thing? ",RHETORICAL, Roland is saying that only a bad person would do something like that,1
3693,TRAIN_0_3693,Roland," I mean, that's something you would do. As soon as he put me on his speakerphone, ",,,0
3694,TRAIN_0_3694,Johnny," No, no, ",,,0
3695,TRAIN_0_3695,Roland, I thought of you. ,,,0
3696,TRAIN_0_3696,Johnny, That's not something... ,,,0
3697,TRAIN_0_3697,Roland, and I can't deal with another you.,,,0
3698,TRAIN_0_3698,Johnny," But-but-but don't worry, 'cause... ",,,0
3699,TRAIN_0_3699,Roland," Well, I am worried!",,,0

3704,TRAIN_0_3704,Roland,  The douchebag is right here.,,,0
3705,TRAIN_0_3705,Mutt, So... you're leaving. What'd Ted say about that?,,,0
3706,TRAIN_0_3706,Alexis, Uh... he proposed.,,,0
3707,TRAIN_0_3707,Mutt, Really? So what'd you tell him?,,,0
3708,TRAIN_0_3708,Alexis, I told him I was leaving.,,,0
3709,TRAIN_0_3709,Mutt," But if you weren't, you would?",,,0
3710,TRAIN_1_3710,Alexis," 'Kay, is this a Barbara Walter special or something? ",RHETORICAL, Alexis is making fun of Mutt for asking so many questions,1
3711,TRAIN_0_3711,Alexis, I'm leaving. That's it. You don't seem to be crying about it. ,,,0
3712,TRAIN_0_3712,Mutt, I think it's nice you're going back to your natural habitat. ,,,0
3713,TRAIN_0_3713,Alexis," I'm not a dolphin, Mutt.",,,0
3714,TRAIN_0_3714,Mutt, You know what I meant. I'm happy for you.,,,0
3715,TRAIN_0_3715,Alexis," Oh. I'm glad you're happy about it. You know, you should really work on expanding your emotional range at some point.",,,0
3716,TRAIN_0_3716,Roland," So what you're saying is, he got a little short with you? ",,,0
3717,TRAIN_0_3717,Johnny," You, uh, you weren't quite seeing eye to eye?",,,0
3718,TRAIN_0_3718,Andy," So, are we gonna sign this puppy or what?",,,0
3719,TRAIN_0_3719,Johnny," Oh, there's a good idea! Andy, I've got the bill of sale right here, and... if you wanna put your John Hancock right there on that first tab- ",,,0
3720,TRAIN_0_3720,Roland, Whoa-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba. Hold on a second here. I think I got a better idea.,,,0
3721,TRAIN_0_3721,Andy, What's that?,,,0
3722,TRAIN_0_3722,Roland, Why don't you come over to the house tonight and try some of Jocelyn's famous mac and cheese. We can sign this then.,,,0
3723,TRAIN_0_3723,Andy, And cheese...,,,0
3724,TRAIN_0_3724,Johnny," Or... or we can sign it now, and then we can dive into some mac and cheese.  Right here, Andy.",,,0
3725,TRAIN_0_3725,Andy," I... I love it. You know, I could really use a good home-cooked meal.",,,0
3726,TRAIN_0_3726,Johnny," Well, right after we sign, we can all have one.",,,0
3727,TRAIN_0_3727,Andy," And according to Roland here, Jocelyn's hot stuff. I can't leave town without meeting her. But then again, if she's that hot what's she doing with this guy? ",,,0
3728,TRAIN_0_3728,Roland, I can't help it if she's got taste!,,,0
3729,TRAIN_1_3729,Andy," Oh yeah, right. Yeah, taste. Yeah. ",SARCASTIC," Andy is making fun of Roland, saying it doesn’t make sense that Jocelyn is married to her",1
3730,TRAIN_1_3730,Alexis," Well, excuse you in that coat! ",SARCASTIC, Alexis likes the coat,1
3731,TRAIN_0_3731,Ronnie, I know! Jocelyn gave it to me.,,,0

3736,TRAIN_0_3736,Alexis, What do you mean?,,,0
3737,TRAIN_0_3737,Ronnie," His hours were up a month ago, he kept coming anyway. ",,,0
3738,TRAIN_0_3738,Alexis, What? ,,,0
3739,TRAIN_1_3739,Ronnie," Yeah, maybe he just got bored... Or maybe he just likes pretty girls in hippy hats. ",SARCASTIC, Ronnie is saying that Mutt likes Alexis,1
3740,TRAIN_1_3740,Ronnie," Know what I mean, string bean? ",RHETORICAL, Ronnie knows that Alexis knows what she means,1
3741,TRAIN_0_3741,Stevie, That's a lot of bags.,,,0
3742,TRAIN_0_3742,David," There's still some space for you though, so don't worry!",,,0
3743,TRAIN_0_3743,Stevie," Yeah... so, um, about New York. Uh, it sounds amazing, but I can't do it, so...",,,0
3744,TRAIN_0_3744,David, Wha-what-what-? Why? What?,,,0
3745,TRAIN_0_3745,Stevie," Uh, I don't think we're on the same page with what going to New York means. ",,,0
3746,TRAIN_0_3746,David, Okay. What does it... does it mean... something?,,,0
3747,TRAIN_0_3747,Stevie," Ugh... I like you. I don't want to like you but I do... And so sharing a space with you as roommates isn't gonna work for me. Um... so I'm gonna take a pass, but um... I'm sure you have a lot of friends who would love to live with you. ",,,0
3748,TRAIN_0_3748,David," Yeah, not as many as you'd think, so... Um... okay. Well, thank you for being honest and um... I wish I could fix this situation.  Um... you've been a great friend. You've been my o-only friend, so... great, nevertheless. Um... you've made my life here survivable.",,,0
3749,TRAIN_1_3749,Stevie, Survivable. Thank-thank you. That is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. ,SARCASTIC, Stevie is saying that “survivable” was probably not the best word to use as it didn’t come across as a compliment,1
3750,TRAIN_0_3750,David, So now I'm gonna go back to New York... by myself and um... and you can just stay here then. ,,,0
3751,TRAIN_0_3751,Stevie,  Yeah. I think that's... That's how it has to be.,,,0
3752,TRAIN_0_3752,David, Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.,,,0
3753,TRAIN_0_3753,Stevie," Okay, bye.",,,0
3754,TRAIN_0_3754,Andy,"  Yeah, my granddad...  Opened our family's first shelf factory in a small town just like this one. I tell you, this place is bursting with opportunity.",,,0
3755,TRAIN_1_3755,Johnny," Well, bursting seems to be the operative word. ",SARCASTIC, Johnny is pointing out that Andy is overeating,1
3756,TRAIN_0_3756,Andy, Mm! So good! ,,,0
3757,TRAIN_0_3757,Roland," Whoa! Slow down there, pal! We got dinner coming and a big desert after... ",,,0
3758,TRAIN_0_3758,Andy, Oh.,,,0
3759,TRAIN_0_3759,Roland, Sex in a pan.,,,0
3760,TRAIN_0_3760,Andy, Oh?,,,0
3761,TRAIN_1_3761,Roland, Then we'll have dessert! ,SARCASTIC," Roland is joking that the sex in a pan is not the desert, but it is",1
3762,TRAIN_0_3762,Andy, I love it! This guy's a prince. He's a prince! ,,,0
3763,TRAIN_0_3763,Moira, So... did you try it on?,,,0
3764,TRAIN_0_3764,Jocelyn, What?,,,0

3772,TRAIN_0_3772,Jocelyn, No. ,,,0
3773,TRAIN_0_3773,Moira," Oh, why not? It's a great coat! At least let us see it on you. ",,,0
3774,TRAIN_0_3774,Jocelyn,"  I gave it away. I'm sorry. It just... it didn't suit me and... I thought about Ronnie and you know she could always use some more feminine pieces in her wardrobe, and so I took it over to her and she really liked it, so I paid it... forward. ",,,0
3775,TRAIN_0_3775,Moira," Well, Jocelyn, there are... certain things that are just not done"," Smoking in a car with a baby, unless you crack a window; tipping before tax; mixing drinks with cola; and giving away a coat that doesn't belong to you. ",,0
3776,TRAIN_0_3776,Mutt,  It's open.,,,0
3777,TRAIN_0_3777,Alexis," Hey. Um... I just came to say... That we'll be leaving as soon as the sale's signed, so... ",,,0
3778,TRAIN_0_3778,Mutt, You must be super excited. ,,,0

3784,TRAIN_0_3784,Mutt, What do you want me to say?,,,0
3785,TRAIN_0_3785,Alexis," Well, could it maybe be because of the fact that you... Enjoy my company?",,,0
3786,TRAIN_0_3786,Mutt, Sure.,,,0
3787,TRAIN_0_3787,Alexis, Don't you even care that I'm leaving?,,,0
3788,TRAIN_0_3788,Mutt, Of course I care. ,,,0
3789,TRAIN_0_3789,Alexis, Then what're you doing?,,,0
3790,TRAIN_0_3790,Mutt, Why are you yelling?,,,0
3791,TRAIN_0_3791,Alexis," Okay, I'm gonna ask you one more time. Mutt, why did you do that extra community service?",,,0

3801,TRAIN_0_3801,David, I'm just wondering when you think we're gonna have the check ready?,,,0
3802,TRAIN_0_3802,Johnny," Well, this is not the time for that, David.",,,0
3803,TRAIN_0_3803,David," Okay, well, you gave me this town as a gift, so I feel like I'm owed a little bit more. So fifty percent for me, fifty percent for you.",,,0
3804,TRAIN_0_3804,Johnny," David, I'm in the middle of something important. ",,,0
